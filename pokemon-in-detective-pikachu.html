The latest trailer is teeming with different Pokémon</h2><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"></figure><p>How many did you catch on your first or second viewing? Since there are so many, there's a good chance you probably missed out on a lot of them, especially with the other teaser trailers and ad spots on the internet. But don't worry, we've got you covered in case you missed a few.</p><p>(Note: some have multiple appearances across all trailers; we did our best to capture them all.)</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">2. Pikachu (duh)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>He’s yellow and he’s cute, but don’t be fooled by this movie’s hero because although he’s not into fighting, he’s a crime-solving badass that won’t stop until he gets to the bottom of his case. The witty, fuzzy creature is voiced by Ryan Reynolds, making him really stand out as the ever-loved main character. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">3. Psyduck, along with Jigglypuff and Gengar (as floaties)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Here, we see the female lead Lucy (Kathryn Newton) standing next to a Psyduck, out on a reporting mission following a major story. Behind them float two balloons as if in a parade: one shaped like a Gengar and one like a Jigglypuff.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">4. Aipom</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Tim and Detective Pikachu get attacked by a group of toothy Aipom... beware the pearly whites!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">5. Emolga</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Gathered on top of food stalls, we see a group of Emolga in the busy market, and to the right, an Audino can be sighted too!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">6. Braviary (up close)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Either that bird's stealing a purse or returning it to someone. Either way, what a majestic bird.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">7. Bulbasaur and Morelull</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>A picturesque scene shows a herd of Bulbosaur crossing the river with Detective Pikachu and Tim (Justice Smith), the male lead following as several Morellul hover about. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">8. Jigglypuff</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Singing on top of an old diner table, Jigglypuff gives an angry glare as he’s interrupted mid-tune. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">9. Charizard</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>It was a very quick glance at the scaly, fire-breathing Charizard, but we can see that it’s fighting someone or something in a battle arena. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">10. Greninja</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>A pack of Greninja slash the screen with their long slimy fingers as their long tongues wrap around their necks.. Not my idea of a cozy scarf but still totally awesome and scary.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">11. Mewtwo</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Looking more human-like than he has in other games, this genetically-created psychic Pokmon looks all sorts of intimidating in the trailer.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">12. Squirtle and Rufflet</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>There’s a crowd of people possibly watching a Pokémon match, but among the crowd you could see a Rufflet on the right and Squirtle on the left trying to get a glimpse of the action.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">13. Mr. Mime</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>The already strange-looking Pokémon, Mr.Mime looks even more bizarre in live-action. Lots of details on this one: the wrinkles around the eyes and textured shoulder balls. What a magnificent work of animated art.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">14. Lickitung</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>In the third teaser, we see this long-tongued Pokémon fully extend its 6.5-foot tongue on screen. And I thought giraffe’s had long tongues!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">15. Octillery Chef</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Just look at this Octopus serving up some delicious food to hardworking people looking for a meal. Love the industriousness of this Pokemon. There's also a Pamcha sitting down enjoying a meal.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">16. Snubbull</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Grumpy face but loyal heart, the Snubbull is seen hanging out with his companion Detective Yoshida (Ken Watanabe). &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">17. Joltik</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>The beginning of the second trailer shoes these little things hurrying along electrical wires, kind of like squirrels I guess.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">18. Ludicolo</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Something about Ludicolo’s eyes as he’s serving Pikachu some coffee say that there’s a lot going on with him.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">19. Arcanine, Growlithe, Golurk, Charmander, and Squirtle</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>The toughest of the toughest Pokémon serve alongside police officers at the station. Golurk make the best security guards and just like in the anime, Officer Jenny has a trusty Growlithe by her side. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">20. Machamp, Snorlax</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Directing traffic is a reliable Machamp while Snorlax is snoozing away and appearing from around a street sign, a Pancham lurks in the midst. along with a lone Jigglypuff on the steps (to the right).</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">21. Loudred</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>It makes total sense that Loudred is hanging with the DJ crew at what seems to be an event of some sort. I'm guessing they're DJing an arena battle, as per the "Critical Hit!" message in the background.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">22. Bouffalant</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>In the trailer, the Bouffalant runs amok in an office. Maybe it's a disgruntled ex employee looking for revenge?</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">23. Gengar, Blastoise, and Magikarp</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Magikarp swim in a tank under the Loudred while a group of Gengar “geng” up on a lone Blastoise.&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">24. Flareon</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Not sure why Flareon is glowing blue on a desk, but he’s so fluffy I’m gonna die!&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">25. Rattata and Treecko</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>In this Pokémon-filled scene, we see two new Poké-faces: you can barely see it but on the left, &nbsp;there’s a Rattata on its hind legs and a Treekco on the top right. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">26. Clefairy, Octillery, and Audino</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>The only way you're going to spot these Pokemon is if you pay extra special close attention, can you see them?&nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">27. Venusaur and Dodrio</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Detective Pikachu casting video trailer</a> gave us an up-close look at a lot of different Pokemon. Like the fully-evolved version of Bulbasaur.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">28. Eevee</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Eevee looks kinda like it had the top of its head shaved here. The versatile, normal-type Pokemon does look cute as all heck, though.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">29. Charmander, Bouffalant, Dodrio, Comfey, Fearow, Braviary, and Flabebe</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>If you’re quick with your eyes, the trailer begins with Flabébé floating about with a Comfey and even a Fearow in the air. Look back down and you’ll see a Braviary and a Dodrio walking and a tiny Charmander in the left corner. Keep staring through the crowd and you’ll discover a Bouffalant out and about. &nbsp;</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">30. Squirtle (he's in it a lot, yeah?)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Here's fan-favorite Squirtle again, this time, we can get a better look at the cute little turtle.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">31. Purrloin</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>A sneaky cat with an excellent name. Not one of the "original" 151 Pokemon, but a cool cat nonetheless. (Persian's my top pick, though.)</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">32. Sneasel</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>This furry ice-type Pokemon appeared in the teaser trailer and it looks like the designers did a good job of porting them to the silver screen.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">33. Rufflet (up close)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>I wish there were owls in real life that looked like this floofy little dude.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">34. Torterra</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Blastoise is a big turtle, Torterra is more like a tortoise. Please know the difference, thank you.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">35. Treecko</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>This fiesty little lizard is soon becoming a fan-favorite and I'm loving the designs/animations they came up with him for the film.</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">36. Kingler</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>This crabby little guy dates back to Pokmon Red and Blue and they got him down pat. Look at that huge left claw!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">37. Pidgeot (Pikachu riding)</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Speaking of birds, we can't forget the OG flying-type, Pidgeot!</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">38. Cubone</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: warner bros.</span></figure><p>Another interesting-looking Pokémon (with a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">sad backstory</a>), Cubone shoots out of a Pokéball ready to fight!&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfpbysscyopWahnmKxpsDEnKuirpVivaq3wJyfrg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
