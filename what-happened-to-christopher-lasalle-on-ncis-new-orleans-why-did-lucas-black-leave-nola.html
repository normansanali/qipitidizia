It has led to a number of questions — including what happened to Christopher Lasalle and why did Lucas Black leave NCIS: NOLA.</p><p>For viewers who missed Season 6, Episode 6 of the show (called Matthew 5:9), we have some really bad news. NCIS Special Agent Christopher Lasalle was murdered. The investigation into his death is still taking place.</p><p>Lasalle had been working on an investigation into the death of his brother, which led him to what seemed like an abandoned cabin. While he was inside with a woman who seemed to have information, a shooter stormed the cabin and ended up killing Lasalle. It was a very dramatic and unexpected moment for many fans.</p><h2>Why did Lucas Black leave NCIS: NOLA?</h2><p>The actor who played Lasalle missed spending time with his family. The filming schedule for a full-run of episodes on a show like this one can be difficult for anyone. For everyone on the NCIS: NOLA cast, it means taking a lot of time away from loved ones.</p><p>Black decided that he wanted to walk away and spend that extra time with his wife, Maggie O’Brien, and their two kids. The couple has a daughter named Sophie Jo and a son named Augusta “Gus” York.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>NCIS: NEW ORLEANS SPOILER ALERT – Fans of NCIS: New Orleans are mourning the loss of a beloved character.
