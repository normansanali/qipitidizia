He showed early signs of having a natural knack for boxing. He attended Everest University after completing his high school education at Davenport Central. In 1993, he made the transition to the professional ranks, and he immediately established himself in the boxing community.</p><p>Echols competed against some of the best boxers of his era, including Bernard Hopkins, the IBF middleweight champion, who he faced off against in 1999. Echols put out a heroic attempt, but he was defeated. He refused to let this setback stop him, though, and he persisted in working towards his goals.</p><p>The most impressive feat for Echols was when he defeated Charles Brewer in a thrilling contest in 2001. Echols found the strength to fight back in the third round and secure a TKO victory, claiming the vacant NABA super middleweight title despite being knocked down three times in the second round. His record was 32 wins, 20 of which were by knockout, and 19 losses up until his retirement in 2011.</p><p>Thanks for reading from <a href=# rel=noopener>Ghsplash</a> a news publishing website from Ghana.
