We all have our favorite <a href=#>George Clooney movie</a> — although the actor worked in TV for decades before making it to the big screen. For some of us, the most entertaining film starring the Kentucky native is One Fine Day, or Out of Sight.</p><p>Whether you loved George in Burn After Reading or Ocean's Eleven (or all of the above!), it's undeniable that, as <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Celebrity Net Worth</a> points out, he is among the top talents in Tinseltown — and the most watchable. As such, it should surprise no one that George had very impressive net worth by the year 2015. But George doubled his net worth in 2017 due to the $1 billion sale of his Casamigos <a href=#>tequila brand</a>, which the star co-owned with Rande Gerber (<a href=#>Cindy Crawford</a>'s husband), per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>.</p><p>Per Celebrity Net Worth, George's net worth stands at $500 million.</p><p class="sc-eEVlDD iAFcKh"><span>George Clooney</span></p><p class="sc-jlZIZy iWVnnf">Actor, Filmmaker, Entrepreneur</p><p><strong>Net worth:</strong> $500 million</p><p><strong>George Clooney is one of the most well-known actors of his generation, best known for starring on </strong><strong>ER</strong><strong> and in hit films like </strong><strong>One Fine Day</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>Up in the Air</strong><strong>, </strong><strong>Ocean's Eleven</strong><strong>, and </strong><strong>The Descendants.</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Birthdate:</strong> May 6, 1961</li><li><strong>Birthplace:</strong> Lexington, Ky.</li><li><strong>Birth name:</strong> George Timothy Clooney</li><li><strong>Father:</strong> Nick Clooney</li><li><strong>Mother:</strong> Nina Bruce Warren</li><li><strong>Marriages: </strong>Talia Balsam (m. 1989-1993); Amal Clooney (m. 2014)</li><li><strong>Children:</strong> Ella and Alexander (b. 2017)</li></ul><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">The amount of money George Clooney made from the Casamigos sale surprised even him.</h2><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><p>The once notorious bachelor — who is now wed to Amal, a human rights lawyer, with whom he <a href=#>shares two kids</a> — shared his reaction to the huge number Diageo paid for Casamigos in an email to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CNBC</a>. “If you asked us four years ago if we had a billion dollar company, I don’t think we would have said yes,” he said at the time. “This reflects Diageo’s belief in our company and our belief in Diageo. But we’re not going anywhere. We’ll still be very much a part of Casamigos. Starting with a shot tonight. Maybe two.”</p><p>George took a step back from his acting career since the sale of the tequila brand, having not acted in a movie since 2016 —&nbsp;until the 2022 flick Ticket to Paradise <a href=#>with Julia Roberts</a>.</p><p>“Look, I acted for a long time and, you know, I’m 56. I’m not the guy that gets the girl anymore,” he told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">The Sunday Times</a> in 2017, going on to joke that he “shouldn’t be the guy that gets the girl." George also noted that depending on the project, he would do it, but that acting doesn't pay his rent any longer. He then acknowledged the obscene amount of money he made from the sale of Casamigos, adding, "I don’t need money.”</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">George Clooney also makes bank on endorsements.</h2><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Nespresso (@nespresso)</a></p></figure><p>Although he may not "need the money," George hasn't shied away from taking on endorsement deals that have added up to a cool $40 million mugging for the likes of Nespresso, Omega, and Fiat, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Insider</a>.
