The lyric "You started kissing me" is changed to "You said you loved me".</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Music_video>Music video</span></h2><p>The music video for this song was used to promote the movie. The video takes place at a drive-in theater where the movie is being shown. Like the song, there are two different versions of this video. In the non-Pokémon version, the scenes from the movie are replaced by additional footage of M2M and the non-Pokémon version of the lyrics is used. The Pokémon version of the video premiered during primetime on The WB on October 24, 1999 during an episode of the show <i>7th Heaven</i>, and was later included as a bonus feature on the first movie's initial DVD release. Like some of the other promo material used to promote the movie's US release, one of the clips used (the scene of Ash and the non-clone Pokémon walking out of the smoke) was from the original Japanese theatrical release, rather than the remastered <i>Kanzenban</i> version.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Remixes_and_other_versions>Remixes and other versions</span></h2><p>There are five remixes of the song made, available on CD and vinyl:</p><li><b>Johnny Vicious Club Mix</b></li><li><b>Lenny Bertoldo Club Mix</b></li><li><b>Matt & Vito Mix</b></li><li><b>Tin Tin Out Mix</b></li><li><b>Johnny Vicious Dub Mix</b></li><p>Additionally, an acoustic version is available on M2M's "<a href=# class=extiw title="wp:Mirror Mirror (M2M song)">Mirror Mirror</a>" single.</p><h2><span class=mw-headline id=Trivia>Trivia</span></h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapaGvorzEnaCaZpKquaOtxpqpnZ2eY7umwI6woKShX3m8r3GRcKuYi5GurJq71JiDqK6VlJqm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
