Perry explained that he was caught off guard and shocked by Diaz accidentally punching him. "'Are you f****** kidding me?' I said, realizing I'd just been punched in the face by Cameron Diaz, and my big arms hadn't helped at all," he recalled.

He revealed that he would find himself at a "party sharing a flirtatious exchange with an attractive woman and cut the conversation short, so I could race home and see if a new fax had arrived.
