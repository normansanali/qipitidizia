Bure also appeared in the Aurora Teegarden franchise about an amateur sleuth who always cracks cases in her small town. Now Bure has been replaced by Skyler Samuels in a prequel movie called Aurora Teagarden Mysteries: Something New.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bure has a high net worth and her <a href=#>QVC line is another income source</a>.

Is the actress upset that someone new is replacing her in the Aurora franchise?</p><p>While Bure doesn't appear to have commented publicly on this news, she seemed to think that she could make more Aurora Teegarden films... but for the Great American Family Network.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Candace-Cameron-Bure-Featured-Image.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bure talked about switching networks</a> in an interview with Variety in September 2022. When she was asked about her Aurora movies, she said, "It’s open. It’s definitely something we would like to revisit for Great American Family. It’s about putting puzzle pieces together, but it’s very possible."</p><p>It's possible to assume that the news that Hallmark is releasing a new Aurora Teegarden movie isn't all that pleasant for Bure. It's tough to see that Great American Family would be allowed to continue the franchise now.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>8 Of Candace Cameron Bure's Most Controversial Moments</a></span></p><p>There are 18 Aurora Teegarden movies, which is pretty amazing to think about. The first film, A Bone To Pick, was released in 2015. And the last film starring Candace Cameron Bure, Haunted By Murder, was released in 2022. If Bure had stayed with Hallmark, she would have likely continued with the franchise since it was so popular.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bure's daughter Natasha also starred in Haunted by Murder and played Aurora when she was younger. Bure told Us Weekly, “Aurora is a very, very curious person. So she’s always studying and she’s very aware of things that other people aren’t. So all of those kinds of notes were really helpful to her as she was playing on Aurora.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/candace-cameron-bure-floral-dress.jpg><p>According to TV Line, the Development Manager of Programming at Hallmark Media, Emily Merlin, talked about how popular the movies are. It definitely makes sense that Hallmark would want to make more movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Merlin said, “Our viewers have been waiting for more adventures with Aurora and her friends. What better way to do that than to take them back to when the young, amateur sleuth was just coming into her own? The Aurora Teagarden franchise is a fan favorite and we’re excited to share this new chapter with viewers.”</p><p>Previously, it wasn't a done deal that more movies would be made. According to Us Weekly, a Crown Media spokesperson explained in 2022 that Hallmark “will air existing [Aurora Teagarden] movies [but have] no plans for new ones.”</p><h2 id=what-was-candace-cameron-bure-paid-for-the-aurora-teegarden-movies>What Was Candace Cameron Bure Paid For The Aurora Teegarden Movies?</h2><p>While it isn't known what Candace Cameron Bure's Aurora Teegarden salary is, she did make good money working for Hallmark. Bure earned much of her $14 million net worth, according to Celebrity Net Worth, from starring on Full House for eight seasons. But she also made a lot of her money from her years with Hallmark.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>What Really Went Down Between JoJo Siwa And Full House's Candace Cameron Bure?</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Yahoo! Entertainment reported that the Screen Actors Guild said that Hallmark pays $1,251.00-$3,575.00 weekly. The publication said that more famous actors will be paid more than that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/candace-cameron-bure-grinning.jpg><p>Since Bure starred in 18 Aurora Teegarden movies from 2015 to 2022, it's easy to assume that she was paid well. And being replaced in the franchise would mean losing out on some good money. Of course, now that Bure has a new deal with Great American Family, she is making a lot of money there.</p><p>Besides no longer being paid for more Aurora movies, it seems possible to assume that Bure will miss playing one of her most well-known characters. In interviews, she always sounded thrilled about taking on this role.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Based on the books by Charlaine Harris, who also wrote the True Blood book series, Aurora Teegarden is about a small town librarian who has a love for true crime. Since she is part of a group called the Real Murders Club, Aurora is used to making connections and thinking about mysteries. And in each movie, she finds herself at the center of a new one, and she's always determined to solve it.</p><p>In an interview with Soaps.sheknows.com, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Bure talked about Aurora Teegarden</a> and the love she had for this character. While Aurora has much in common with typical small town Hallmark characters, she's also smart and inquisitive, and that makes her interesting to watch.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>With Candace Cameron Bure Gone, Hallmark's Lacey Chabert Is Set To Earn Millions</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Bure said, "I love Aurora because she’s got a lot of spunk and she’s a kick-butt kind of woman. She’s always two steps ahead of everyone. She also has a good team around her – but they’re always a little more concerned for her safety than even she is, because she’s relentless."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/candace-cameron-bure-smiling.jpg><p>Bure continued to Soaps.sheknows.com that she could relate to Aurora's determined personality.</p><p>She said, "In every movie there’s a little bit of stunt work because she always gets into a battle with a suspect or the actual killer, and I do 99 percent of the stuntwork myself. There’s a lot of me in her, and she has the drive I do."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/candace-cameron-bure.jpg><p>Perhaps Candace Cameron Bure has moved on from Aurora Teegarden. She does seem to be looking to the future. In April 2023, she shared a Deadline story on her Instagram account about her next project: starring in My Christmas Hero, A Great American Family Christmas movie that will be available during the 2023 holiday season.</p><p>Bure will play Nicole Ramsey in the film. She will also play a character named Kay Alright in Unsung Hero.
