Your mind probably automatically created a centaur; a being with the head, torso, and arms of a man, but with the lower body of a horse, complete with four legs and a tail. That‚Äôs probably because you‚Äôve seen one before ‚Äî not in real life, of course, but in movies and shows like Harry Potter, Narnia, or Percy Jackson. Most people understand the concept; but now imagine you didn‚Äôt, imagine you‚Äôd never heard of a centaur before and re-read that description, how would you interpret that? Maybe you‚Äôd come up with something like this?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Pegasus.jpg><p data-characters=16 data-current-count=316 data-injectable=false>Or perhaps this?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Centaur-1.jpg><p data-characters=22 data-current-count=22 data-injectable=false>Or possibly even this?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Centaur-2.jpg><p data-characters=449 data-current-count=771 data-injectable=true>These are the images an AI came up with in an attempt to create a centaur for TikTok user Emily Anne, who was conducting ‚Äúcentaur research.‚Äù I‚Äôm going to be honest, I think I actually quite like some of these designs, it‚Äôs about time some new centaurs dropped. Why settle for the weak body arms and head type centaurs when you can have the Chad head centaur? That‚Äôs just one example, things only proceed to get worse as the TikTok goes on.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@emhahee href=#>@emhahee</a><p>This gave me a good laugh what is happeninf</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - emily anne üçâ" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound ‚Äì emily anne üçâ</a></figure><p data-characters=465 data-current-count=765 data-injectable=true>Oddly enough the AI seems to have a grasp of other fantasy creatures as the first image it creates is a pegasus which Emily points is ‚Äúdefinitely not a centaur‚Äù ‚Äî and she would know, she‚Äôs researching them. It does beg the question of how an AI can understand perfectly one example of a Greek mythological beast, yet fail so miserably at understanding another. Surely a half-man half-horse is easier to grasp than a half-horse half-bird with a unicorn horn?</p><p data-characters=504 data-current-count=504 data-injectable=true>Things continue to get more unhinged, with a later image featuring, inexplicably, a kangaroo jumping up at the centaur abomination? Like how do you even make that logical leap? Where does the kangaroo fit in this equation? Another attempt by the AI, which has clearly lost it‚Äôs mind at this point, gives Emily a horse with the torso of a man with a dove coming out the stomach, and the head on top of the torso is a horse‚Äôs head ‚Äî oh, and one more thing, he‚Äôs also carrying a kangaroo, of course.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=false>You know, it‚Äôs somewhat a relief to still see things like this, it‚Äôs a reminder that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">AI can‚Äôt do everything yet</a>. And when it fails to comprehend something, boy, does it fail spectacularly. One day far in the future, when we‚Äôre all slaves to the robot overlord, we‚Äôll always be able to look back and smile about the good old days when AI thought that the word ‚Äúcentaur‚Äù meant a horse-man-horse fighting a kangaroo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e9OhnKudXZ7AbrTOqZxmmZeWtq%2B%2F02aYomWpmsFutMSrpqKbXZ28s7%2FEZp6iqpxivbO71aKbnqtdnbatrdGipq6rXZrDqrDEp5qeZaSdrrV5wKJkoqueqXqzscCdsGasn2KwsLrQrpyrZaSdsm7DzqujnWWaqsC1edieq2g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
