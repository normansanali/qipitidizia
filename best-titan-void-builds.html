Now that it's been out for some time, we can finally take a look at the revamped mod system and put together what we consider to be <strong>top-tier Meta builds</strong>.&nbsp;</p><p>But what makes a build good? Well, it all depends on what you want to do. If you're a PVE fanatic, you might find more value in builds that are better for burst damage and survivability. PVP players might need faster recovery and snappier movement options.</p><p>Let's get down to brass tacks and take a look at <strong>the best PVE and PVP builds for Void Titans in <a href=#>Destiny 2</a>.</strong></p><h2>Table of Contents</h2><h2 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jadi>Best Void Titan PVE Build: Purple Reign</h2><p>The best offense is a good defense, right? Well, this <strong>Void Titan build</strong> is going to show your enemies just how well-guarded you can be. While this build doesn't give you the same level of ability spam as the Arc or <strong><a href=#>Solar Titan</a></strong> builds do, it will keep you and your friends alive with a <strong>relentless&nbsp;amount of Overshields, Volatile rounds, and explosions</strong>. This build isn't nearly as Exotic-reliant as most, but the <strong>Helm of Saint-14</strong> is going to be our go-to for this one.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/M40azlXjTFwgRxBVCVTRGYf0bAzhiwkIYUh86qHjLSo/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9EZXN0aW55XzIvYnVpbGRzL1RpdGFuX0J1aWxkcy90aWdlcl9yZWxlYXNlX2ZpbmFsXzIwMjMwODEzXzE1NTA0Ni5wbmc><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jadj><strong>Required Gear</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Exotic Armor:</strong> Helm of Saint-14 (Helm)</li></ul><p><strong>The Helm of Saint-14 will blind any enemies</strong> that foolishly decide to cross into it <strong>while granting an Overshield to you and your allies</strong> that dip in and out of its protecting bubble. If you decide to play around a bit with the playstyle of this build, it will also make enemies nearby blind if you opt for the Sentinel Shield block super.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jadk>Class Setup</h3><ul><li><strong>Super:</strong> Ward of Dawn</li><li><strong>Grenade: </strong>Vortex grenades</li><li><strong>Class Ability</strong>: The choice is yours, but<strong> Rally Barricade</strong> has the benefit of faster reload times&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Melee: </strong>Shield Throw</li><li><strong>Jump:</strong> Catapult Lift</li></ul><p>The Rally Barricade is optimal here for sure, and while Shield Throw is a little unusual, it will create explosions when used in this build. So get those ranged melees ready to go!&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jadl>Aspects</h3><ul><li><strong>Bastion:&nbsp;</strong>This aspect grants an Overshield to you and your allies when you cast your Super and your Barricade. <strong>The Overshield from your Barricade cast will regenerate and have its duration extended while you're behind it</strong>, so take advantage of your Barricade in combat.</li><li><strong>Controlled Demolition:</strong> hitting a target with a Void ability or Volatile explosion will make them Volatile, which will then cause them to explode upon death.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jadm>Fragments</h3><ul><li><strong>Echo of Expulsion&nbsp;</strong>makes Void ability final flows explode</li><li><strong>Echo of Exchange</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>grants grenade energy on Melee final blows</li><li><strong>Echo of Instability</strong> grants Volatile Rounds to your Void weapons after defeating targets with grenades</li><li><strong>Echo of Undermining</strong> applies Weaken to targets damaged with your Void grenades</li></ul><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jadn>Armor Mods</h3><p>Outside of Stat Mods, you'll want to min/max for ability uptime to further lean into the Grenade, Melee, and Class Ability spam that this build is all about.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Head Mods:</strong> I recommend <strong>Ashes to Assets, Harmonic Siphon, and Heavy Ammo Finder</strong> for more orbs, more super energy, and heavy ammo</li><li><strong>Arm Mods:</strong> I recommend <strong>Grenade Kickstart, Harmonic Loader, and Impact Induction</strong> for more grenade energy and faster void weapon reload speed</li><li><strong>Chest Mods:</strong> I recommend <strong>Emergency Reinforcement</strong> and whatever damage reduction mods of your choosing. Emergency Reinforcement is crazy strong right now and a requirement for high-end content.</li><li><strong>Leg Mods:</strong> I recommend <strong>Void Weapon Surge, Recuperation, and Orbs of Restoration</strong>. These will grant you additional Void weapon damage as well as additional health and ability recharge.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Mark Mods:</strong> I recommend <strong>Time Dilation, Bomber, and Outreach</strong> for longer Armor Charge duration and increased cooldowns on grenades and melee charges.&nbsp;</li></ul><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jado>Weapons</h3><ul><li><strong>Kinetic Slot: Witherhoard (recommended)</strong>&nbsp;While not required, Witherhoard is a kinetic slot grenade launcher that deals <strong>DOT (damage over time)</strong>. It is a great way to apply constant DPS to enemies, keep your grenade uptime going consistently, and is just a fun weapon to use.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Energy Slot:</strong>&nbsp;The choice here is yours, but I do recommend either <strong><a href=#>Funnelweb</a></strong> to help spread Volatile quickly or <strong><a href=#>Doom of Chelchis</a></strong>&nbsp;from King's Fall, which can roll (or be crafted) with both Firefly and Dragonfly, spreading explosions and Volatile Rounds with deadly speed.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Heavy Slot:&nbsp;</strong>Again, this is entirely up to you. Right now, <strong>Grenade Launchers and Rockets have become favorable</strong>, but Linear Fusion Rifles are still a great option. Regardless of what it is, <strong>I recommend a Void Heavy weapon</strong> to lean into the synergy of the build.&nbsp;</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/Wafn3-g8pOxHc_lNZVtBPCSSp8nL7ne-S0NxzN1B6K8/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9EZXN0aW55XzIvYnVpbGRzL1RpdGFuX0J1aWxkcy90aWdlcl9yZWxlYXNlX2ZpbmFsXzIwMjMwODEzXzE1NTA1MS5wbmc><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jadp>Stat Distribution&nbsp;</h3><p>For these, you'll want to focus on <strong>as much Resilience and Recovery as possible</strong> for both survivability, but also Barricade uptime. Next would be a <strong>minimum of 60 Discipline</strong>, but anything higher is obviously better. The rest of the stats are completely up to you.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jadq>Conclusion</h3><p>This build requires a bit more care about how you're using your abilities, but as long as you're supporting your teammates, this can absolutely stand up with the best of them. I recommend testing this out in a <strong>Legend or Master Lost Sector</strong> or even taking it into a couple of Grandmaster Nightfalls just to see how you like it and what you'd like to change!&nbsp;</p><h2 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jadr>Best Void Titan PVP Build: Suppressing Force</h2><p>This Void Titan PVP build is all about trying to <strong>lean more into the Subclass 3.0 verbs more than most PVP builds do</strong>. While that might sound difficult, we're still just going to be Aping as much as possible, and thankfully, this Titan fantasy will work well with that<strong>. Shoulder Charge,&nbsp; throw down Barricades as much as you can, and keep your Overshield up so you can spam those Suppressor Grenades!</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/PdHZ2jdMw2Z10KD4igdneUkIcOS6XCY--Umfo4vBOsU/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9EZXN0aW55XzIvYnVpbGRzL1RpdGFuX0J1aWxkcy90aWdlcl9yZWxlYXNlX2ZpbmFsXzIwMjMwODEzXzE2MzA1NC5wbmc><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jads><strong>Required Gear</strong></h3><ul><li><strong>Exotic Armor:</strong> Peregrine Greaves (legs)</li></ul><p>Shoulder Charge like you've never Shoulder Charged before! With these boots, <strong>jumping just before a Shoulder Charge grants you extra damage,</strong> which is the only way to one-hit-kill just about anyone in PVP with it.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jadk>Class Setup</h3><ul><li><strong>Super:</strong> Ward of Dawn</li><li><strong>Grenade: </strong>Suppressor Grenade</li><li><strong>Class Ability</strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>The choice is yours, but I go for <strong>Towering Barricade</strong></li><li><strong>Melee: </strong>Shield Bash</li><li><strong>Jump:</strong> Catapult Lift</li></ul><p>This build is based around<strong> Overshields, Shoulder Charging, and Suppressor Grenades.</strong>&nbsp;Make sure you don't forget to switch if you were just running some PVE content!</p><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jadl>Aspects</h3><ul><li><strong>Bastion:&nbsp;</strong>This aspect grants an Overshield to you and your allies when you cast your Super and your Barricade. <strong>The Overshield from your Barricade cast will regenerate and have its duration extended while you're behind it</strong>, so take advantage of your Barricade in combat.</li><li><strong>Offensive Bulwark:</strong> while you have an <strong>Overshield</strong> or are inside a Ward of Dawn, <strong>your grenade energy charges significantly faster, your melee range and damage are increased, and melee final blows extend the duration of your Overshield.</strong></li></ul><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jadm>Fragments</h3><p>These won't have an enormous effect on your gameplay in PVP, but getting the extra leg up over your competition is always helpful, especially if they're running simpler builds!</p><ul><li><strong>Echo of Expulsion&nbsp;</strong>makes Void ability final flows explode</li><li><strong>Echo of </strong><strong>Exchange </strong>grants grenade energy on Melee final blows</li><li><strong>Echo of Dialtion </strong>while crouched, you sneak faster and gain enhanced radar</li><li><strong>Echo of Domineering</strong> after suppressing a target, you gain greatly increased mobility for a short time, and your equipped weapon is reloaded. Defeating suppressed targets creates a Void Breach.</li></ul><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jad10>Armor Mods</h3><p>Outside of Stat Mods, you'll want to min/max for weapon steadiness and handling. These are all pretty straightforward and grant bonus weapon stats and ability recovery.&nbsp;</p><ul><li><strong>Head Mods:</strong> I recommend <strong>Kinetic <span>OR</span> Energy Targeting</strong></li><li><strong>Arm Mods:</strong> I recommend <strong>Grenade Kickstart and Reloaders</strong> of your choice</li><li><strong>Chest Mods:</strong> I recommend <strong>Unflinching mods</strong> of your choice</li><li><strong>Leg Mods:</strong> I recommend <strong>Absolution, Better Already, Orbs of Restoration</strong></li><li><strong>Mark Mods:</strong> I recommend <strong>Reaper, Bomber, Outreach</strong></li></ul><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jad11>Weapons</h3><ul><li><strong>Kinetic Slot:</strong> I recommend a <strong>Kinetic Sniper or Shotgun</strong>. This will free up your energy slot for a void primary weapon, but using a primary in your kinetic slot in favor of a Void special weapon is okay, too. Go with your heart, here!</li><li><strong>Energy Slot:</strong> This might sound silly, but if we're entertaining the idea of annoying your opponents, I cannot recommend <strong>Graviton Lance</strong> more. This weapon fires a two-round burst that, when killed, makes enemies create a void explosion which also spawns Axion Bolt-like Void projectiles that track enemies. This gun is silly, fun, and extremely grating on the other team.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Heavy Slot</strong><strong>:&nbsp;</strong>Take your pick, but I always recommend a synergistic weapon based on your build. Of course, it doesn't matter quite as much in PVP, but a <strong>Void Rocket</strong> is going to do well here.&nbsp;</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/XaJahBTJ5gLgNWkEnREh5kljKe6qMo3WU3wlztZcWnY/rs:fill:0:0:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi9EZXN0aW55XzIvYnVpbGRzL1RpdGFuX0J1aWxkcy90aWdlcl9yZWxlYXNlX2ZpbmFsXzIwMjMwODEzXzE2MjUyMS5wbmc><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jad12>Stat Distribution&nbsp;</h3><p>For these, you'll want to focus on <strong>100 Resilience and at least 90 Recovery</strong> for both survivability, but also Barricade uptime. Next would either be <strong>Strength, to maximize your Shoulder Charge recharge rate</strong> or <strong>Discipline to maximize your Grenade recharge!</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mcetoc_1gtdn7jad13>Conclusion</h3><p>This is the most ability spam PVP build I've ever seen, and it's a ton of fun if you can get it rolling in the right ways. Try this out next time you're running <a href=#><strong>Trials of Osiris</strong></a> or dipping your toes in the Iron Banner!&nbsp;</p><p>These are <strong>the best Void Titan builds for PVE and PVP</strong>. Make sure you save them in your <strong><a href=#>new Loadout slots</a></strong> before you start moving on to your next build!</p><p>For more <a href=# rel=noopener>Destiny 2 news</a>, be sure to check out our dedicated section or take a look at some of our <a href=# rel=noopener>Guides & Tutorials</a>&nbsp;just below:</p><p><strong>Weekly Updates</strong></p><p><strong>Future Content</strong></p><p><strong>Best Hunter Builds</strong></p><p><strong>Best Titan Builds</strong></p><p><strong>Best Warlock Builds</strong></p><p><strong>Emblem & Shaders</strong></p><p><strong>Exotics, Catalyst & God Roll Guides</strong></p><p><strong>Game Guides</strong></p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/imgcdn/5g-4Ivu6kGDfjdqrAK_MP0OQIfNkgoli1LvQyvmxzCo/rs:fill:180:180:1/g:ce/aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ2lueC50di91cGxvYWRzMi8xX1N0YWZmX1Bob3Rvcy90cmFuc3BhcmVudF9tZS5wbmc alt="Austin Ford" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Written by <a href=#>Austin Ford</a></h3><p>Austin is a freelance writer, theatre nerd, and lapsed stand-up comedian. His love for writing and dissection of video games brought him to the games journalism space where he’s written for outlets like <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sk=tooltip_parent data-stringify-link=https://www.theouterhaven.net/author/austin/>The Outerhaven</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" data-sk=tooltip_parent data-stringify-link=https://xboxera.com/author/pfhorbear2054/>XboxEra</a>.

With multiple Day One Raid completions, Austin likes to think of himself as an expert not only in Destiny but Bungie’s entire catalog of games. When not actively obsessing over The Traveler, Austin is also a fan of indie titles and JRPGs. If you ask him what his favorite game of all time is, he’d say Jak and Daxter: The Precursor Legacy and will not rest until a sequel or Reboot is in his hands.</p><p>Follow me on:&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><a href=# rel=nofollow><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ginx.tv/bundles/app/images/theme2020/logo/svg/twitter.svg?av_20240202_155604 alt=Twitter style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qLXNsWWtrl%2Bau3CwxKyroqapYn9wrsSsq2asmamur3nVqKCdZZKqtq2w0g%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
