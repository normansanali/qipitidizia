Tofuu uses Roblox to amuse his viewers.</p><p>He has accumulated over 4 million subscribers and over 1 billion views since joining YouTube on April 26, 2011.</p><p>It's breaking news that the YouTuber hasn't posted a video since 2021. He also hasn't interacted on any of his social media. His lack of presence on YouTube and other social media sites has alarmed his fans.</p><h2>Quick Info</h2><table class="table table-bordered content-table"><tbody><tr><td><strong>Name</strong></td><td>Tofuu</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Real name</strong></td><td>Hayden Joseph “Joe” Griffin</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Born</strong></td><td>November 1, 1998</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Age</strong></td><td>24( as of 2022)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td>American</td></tr></tbody></table><h2 id=what-happened-to-tofuu-ro>What Happened To Tofuu? Roblox YouTuber's Real Name</h2><p>Hayden Joseph "Joe" Griffin, better known as Tofu and formerly as Tofuugaming.</p><p>His final YouTube video was uploaded on August 2, 2021, while his final <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> post was published on August 6, 2021. He has stopped publishing on his main YouTube channel, a few backup channels, and his community tab.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/c42604be-2847-4bc9-882a-8e563d4cd6a2.webp></p><p>Given the lack of proof of his return to the platform even after a year away, it is not unusual for a well-known YouTuber like Tofuu to be the target of demise rumors.</p><p>Tofuu's forcefully taken over Roblox account asserts that the last time he was online was on January 27, 2022, making the claims of his demise simple to disprove.</p><p>He may be staying away from social media due to his active Roblox account and low activity there. Uploading movies to several platforms every day is a difficult task, and carrying on that pattern for years sounds incredibly stressful.</p><p>He is naturally taking a break from all digital social media to spend some time by himself.</p><h2 id=how-much-is-tofuu-net-wor>How Much Is Tofuu's Net Worth In 2022?</h2><p>Tofuu is estimated to be worth about <strong>$167,73,000</strong>.</p><p>A channel that uses advertising to monetize makes money for each 1,000 video views. On average, YouTubers can get $3 to $7 for every thousand video views. With the use of these calculations, we can determine that Tofuu earns $2.8000 every month, or $41.93000 annually.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/4f0c1e3c-c599-424e-ba17-e47099bfbba4.webp></p><p>Our estimate, however, may be too low. If Tofuu's video advertisements are successful, they could earn close to $75.48 thousand per year.</p><p>At first, Hayden barely reached 1,000 views on his films, but he persisted and continued to submit new movies at least once a week despite the lack of initial success.</p><p>His early videos primarily focused on "Minecraft," but they also included gameplay from other well-known games such as "Star Wars: Battlefront II," "Skyrim," and "Medal of Honor."</p><h2 id=where-is-twitch-streamer->Where Is Tofuu Now In 2022?</h2><p>Because neither the confirmed news of him passing away nor the reason he isn't active on his YouTube account has been made public, we are unable to exactly ascertain Tofu's status and whereabouts.</p><p>He's probably still alive and taking a break from social media for self-care.</p><p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/admin.showbizcorner.com/uploads/2022/9/98dccd67-3bf9-40cd-87fa-93995c432b91.webp></p><p>These are but a few instances of individuals reflecting on Tofuu's demise. You can tell that a sizable following has been sarcastically discussing the rumor of his passing by reading through the comments on his videos.</p><p>Because a YouTuber with Tofuu's fame would have had greater sway online, and his passing would have been widely reported, the aforementioned claim has minimal chance of being accurate.</p><p>Although Tofuu is still alive, he hasn't posted anything to his well-liked YouTube channel, which is why speculation about his demise is gaining traction.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirmKTEo7XZnKarppWne6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8bsDOn6yu</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
