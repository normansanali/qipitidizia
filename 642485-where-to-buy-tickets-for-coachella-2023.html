Car camping and tent camping are also sold out on ‘Coachella’s’ website.</p><p>With the cheapest general admission option, attendants will gain entrance into the venue and be provided with day parking lots for all three days. This option does not include shuttle access to the venue.</p><p>The VIP option for weekend two offers specialty food & drink vendors, air-conditioned restrooms, shaded seating areas and full cash bars. Attendants who purchase the VIP option will also have access to shuttles to the venue and can visit the car and tent camping areas.</p><p>Outside of the official ‘Coachella’ website, tickets are available on StubHub for both weekends one and two. The starting price for general admission tickets for weekend one on StubHub is $500 and can reach up to $9,450 for exclusive seating and hotel packages. Tickets on StubHub for weekend two start at $414 for general admission seating. This was the cheapest option out of all sites selling tickets to ‘Coachella’ for general admission seating.</p><p>Tickets for ‘Coachella’ on Vividseat’s website are roughly the same price with general admission tickets for both weekends starting at around $450.
