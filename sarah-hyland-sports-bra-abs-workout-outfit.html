The Modern Family actress just got engaged to her boyfriend of two years <strong>Wells Adams</strong>, 25, back in July and she put her taut tummy on full display when she opted to wear a tiny white spaghetti strap sports bra, which she paired with high-waisted, black <strong>Lululemon In Movement Crop Everlux 19″</strong> leggings. Tucked into the front of her leggings was a bright red towel that read “1990” and she accessorized with a pair of black platform <strong>Birkenstock</strong> sandals, <strong>Givenchy Gv7090 Oval Sunglasses, </strong>and a black <strong>Tom Ford Jennifer Saddle Bag</strong>. Considering her bra was so small and not really a crop top, her toned abs were the main attraction of this entire outfit and she looked fabulous. As for her hair, Sarah rocked two of this season’s hottest trends – a messy bun and a headband. She threw her dark <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>brown long wavy hair</a> into a messy bun atop her head, while a thick black headwrap was wrapped around her head.</p><p id=content-paragraph-2>Sarah has been showing off her toned figure a lot lately and one of our favorite recent outfits from the star was at the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Teen Choice Awards</a> on August 11. She looked absolutely flawless when she wore a matching <strong>Teresa Helbig</strong> two-piece set. The set featured a tiny little pink and white lace bralette with orange spaghetti straps and a plunging V-neckline, showing off ample cleavage. She paired the tiny top with the matching high-waisted mini skirt, which was extra short, showing off her long, toned legs. She accessorized her look with a pair of bright orange <strong>Loriblu</strong> heels and dazzling <strong>Lorraine Schwartz</strong> jewels.</p><p id=content-paragraph-3>We’ve seriously been loving Sarah’s style lately and just the other day she tried out yet another trend – <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>the maxi dress</a>. Sarah was running errands in LA on Sunday, August 18, when she looked fabulous in a fun <strong>Bijou Dress in Octavia</strong>. The white maxi dress featured a pretty blue and red floral print and a ruched bodice that cinched in her tiny waist, while long sleeves and high, poofy shoulders completed the top. The rest of the maxi flowed out into a pleated skirt, ending at her ankles, while a pair of olive green pointy-toed pumps, matching purse, and aviator sunglasses completed her look.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/sarah-hyland-shows-off-rock-hard-abs-in-sports-bra-embed.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-4>&nbsp;</p><p id=content-paragraph-5>Sarah has been looking the best she’s ever looked and we cannot wait to see what she wears on her special wedding day.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWlpZH15e5FqZqyZopa1brTYpZinnF2ovbC%2B06xkm6qRYq6jv4ywpqujn6rBbrvUrZ2irF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
