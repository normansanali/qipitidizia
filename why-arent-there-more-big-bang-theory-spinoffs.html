No one could have predicted the huge success <strong><a href=#>The Big Bang Theory</a></strong> would go on to become. In fact, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">its pilot received so many negative responses</a>, that many aspects were reworked after the initial viewings. When it finally made it to the small screen, the show which embraced the nerd culture wasn’t an instant hit. However, by its second season, fans couldn’t wait to watch the social ineptitude of its geeky characters.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>By the time the sitcom ended in 2019 after 279 episodes in its twelve-season run, it was a billion-dollar asset, and one of the most successful shows on TV.</p><h2 id=why-did-big-bang-theory-end>Why Did Big Bang Theory End?</h2><p>The decision to end TBBT wasn’t based on falling numbers, but rather on the decision of the actor who played Sheldon Cooper.

Although it’s followed in the parent show’s footsteps and become CBS’ second most popular comedy, fans of the original series have been critical of the offshoot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>They cite <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">many inconsistencies in the spinoff</a>, specifically around some of the storylines which had been set in the original series.

But producers are adamant there’ll be no sequels.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The show was created by Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady, who were also executive producers. Interviewed after the show’s final wrap, Lorre spoke to TV Line. Asked about spinoffs, he answered that t<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">he producers never seriously considered any character spinoffs</a>.</p><p>“Truthfully, the reason for a spinoff is economics, and that’s not the reason to do a show.
