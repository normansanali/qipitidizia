Of course, if you’ve noticed a similarity between the ambitious television show and Peter Jackson’s two trilogies, it’s partially due to the fact that Amazon has comissioned the talented John Howe, who previously worked on Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit, to draw the concept art for this outing as well.</p><p data-characters=523 data-current-count=523 data-injectable=true>And so, through conscious choice, the visual language of Middle-earth in The Rings of Power pays homage to what came before. But the familiarities don’t stop there. In fact, even barring certain characters like Elrond and Galadriel, it seems that the ancestors of a lot of our favorite characters are making their live-action debut in this show, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">even if viewers don’t necessarily get the confirmation for it yet</a>. In the case of Thorin, though, Tolkien’s works can help us answer the question definitively.</p><h2 id=h-are-thorin-oakenshield-and-durin-iv-related data-injectable=false><strong>Are Thorin Oakenshield and Durin IV related?</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/the-rings-of-power-elrond-durin.jpg><p data-characters=268 data-current-count=568 data-injectable=true>The Rings of Power features Prince Durin IV as the heir of Khazad-Dum, aka Moria. And as you’ll already know, the series takes place some 3,000 years before the events of The Hobbit, so strictly speaking, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">three millennia separate Durin IV and Thorin Oakenshield</a>.</p><p data-characters=362 data-current-count=362 data-injectable=false>That being said, based on what Tolkien has revealed in the legendarium books (like The Silmarillion or even The Return of the King appendices) we know that Thorin Oakenshield and his kin, recognized by everyone as the House of Durin, are a direct descendant of the legendary Durin the Deathless, the founder of Khazad-Dum and the first of the Fathers of Dwarves.</p><p data-characters=433 data-current-count=795 data-injectable=true>Durin the Deathless was succeeded by Durin II, and that continued all the way to Durin VI. The sixth herald of the house then gave up the mantle to Nain I, and he to Thrain I, and he to Thorin I. After Thorin the First came Oin, Gloin, and Nain II, and after Nain II came Dain I, who was the great grandfather of Thorin Oakenshield, being survived through Thror, Thorin’s grandfather, and finally Thrain, Thorin’s father.</p><p data-characters=327 data-current-count=327 data-injectable=false>Feeling confused, yet? Well, don’t worry. All you need to know is that Durin IV from The Rings of Power was, indeed, the ancestor of our own Thorin Oakenshield. In fact, even Gimli from The Lord of the Rings is a descendant of the House of Durin, even if he doesn’t mention it nearly as much as the rest of his kin.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMRmqaKml6h6sLKMqaawnaJitrR5w66poqZdp7KtrdOem2asn2LBqbvRoqVmp5Ggsq%2B%2Fx6KcpZxf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
