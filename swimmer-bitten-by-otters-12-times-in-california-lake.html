Nothing even comes close.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Matt Leffers survived a vicious otter attack while swimming in a California lake in September.</figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Leffers was swimming in Serene Lakes in Placer County when otters began biting him. <span class=credit>KCRA</span></figure><p>He felt the first bite on his calf, and another just seconds later.</p><p>“And then I started swimming fast but there was the otter, popped up right in front of me and then I was bit again,” Leffers recalled.</p><p>The swimmer’s wife rescued him from the group of otters — known as a romp — on a paddleboard and then took him to a hospital to be treated for roughly 40 puncture wounds caused by the animals’ sharp teeth.</p><p>The otter mauling left the victim covered in scars – and seeing red. It came two months after an otter bit another swimmer in the same lake, according to the California Department of Fish and Wildlife.</p><p>“I think the fact that I’m the second person attacked here this summer, it’s a big red flag,” Leffers said.</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Leffers was bitten at least 12 times and suffered roughly 40 puncture wounds caused by the furry assailants’ sharp teeth. <span class=credit>Courtesy Matt Leffers</span></figure><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">Leffers had to be rescued from the water by his wife and taken to the hospital. <span class=credit>Courtesy Matt Leffers</span></figure><p>He said he had been swimming in that lake, where his family owns a cabin, for 30 years and had never experienced anything like what happened to him in the familiar waters two months ago.</p><p>Peter Tira, a spokesperson for the California Department of Fish and Wildlife, said that while otter attacks on people are very rare, they are a predator species.</p><p>“They won’t normally attack people or larger animals. However, they will defend their territory if they feel threatened, whether that’s a real threat or perceived threat,” Tira said.</p><p>Leffers called the agency’s response to the otter incident “wimpy” — and argued for the animals’ removal from the lake “before somebody gets killed.”</p><figure class="nyp-slideshow-modal-image wp-block-image aligncenter size-large">An otter attacked and bit another person in Serene Lakes in July. <span class=credit>Los Angeles Times via Getty Images</span></figure><p>Several otter attacks have been reported in recent months, including one in September, when <a href=#>a rabid otter bit a 74-year-old man</a> and a dog in Florida.</p><p>Just weeks earlier, three women were injured — and one of them<a href=#> lost a chunk of her right ear</a> — when an angry otter attacked them while they were tubing down a Montana river.</p><p>In July, a female otter made international headlines by <a href=#>snatching boards from surfers</a> near Santa Cruz, California, and repeatedly evaded capture.</p><p>In October, it was reported that the sneaky otter, dubbed “841”, had given birth to a pup and was seen floating with her baby resting on her belly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmaWtfo7K4v46srqKlnZq%2Fbq7Irauepl2Xxm67062cq6tdZn9uwMimnKxlmaN6pK3Lop2oqp6erm64wKScaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
