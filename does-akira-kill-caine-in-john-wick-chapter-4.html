She demands that he kills Caine to avenge her father, pledging that she will do the deed herself if he doesn’t. Despite their differences, John still has a soft spot for Caine, and doesn’t make any promises – only telling Akira that he understands.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=498 data-current-count=498 data-injectable=true>This plot thread is left dangling throughout the remainder of the movie. John and Caine ultimately have their unwilling showdown on the doorstep of Sacré Coeur, and while they leave each other battered, bruised, and bleeding, they part ways as friends. <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">John seemingly “dies,”</a> while Caine lives another day, leaving Akira’s revenge arc unresolved. That is, unless you stuck around for the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">series-first post credits scene</a>, which catches up with Caine on his way to reunite with his daughter.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-happened-between-akira-and-caine data-injectable=false>What happened between Akira and Caine?&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/akira-john-wick.png><p data-characters=260 data-current-count=560 data-injectable=true>In the brief sequence, we see a now-free Caine approaching his daughter with a bouquet of flowers and an ear-to-ear smile, the character seemingly at peace as his child busks in the streets. However, through the crowd we see Akira, looking ready for vengeance.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=360 data-injectable=false>Akira weaves her way through the crowd and towards Caine, who still appears to be in blissful ignorance of his situation and enjoying his daughter’s music, unable to recognize the threat that is approaching him due to his impaired vision. As Akira closes the gap between herself and her father’s murderer, knife in hand, the screen cuts to black.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=392 data-current-count=752 data-injectable=true>From here, we can only really speculate as to what happens next, but the situation did not appear to be unfolding in Caine’s favor, who seemed to well and truly have his guard down. There’s every likelihood that Akira manages to get the drop on Caine and wound, perhaps even kill him, but given the movie that we’ve just watched, we know that Caine is extremely capable when in a pinch.</p><p data-characters=437 data-current-count=437 data-injectable=false>The way we like to interpret it is that the pair definitely end up in some sort of altercation, but the victor is unknown. Perhaps it is some sort of setup for yet another John Wick spinoff (on top of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ballerina</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Continental</a>), because it would truly be a shame to see these two extremely interesting characters be one-film characters who ultimately die. Though really, “such is life” for the denizens of the John Wick universe.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJom6ido2KurLXRmmSkoZyheqStyKecZqGeYrewtM1mrqKbm2Kwqa3PrZyrZWRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
