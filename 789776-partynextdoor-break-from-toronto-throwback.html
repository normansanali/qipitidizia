For instance, below, you can listen to one of his first big hits, "Break From Toronto." This is a song that dropped 10 years ago, and that is going to make some of you out there feel very old. Regardless, this is a song you probably have some fond memories of.</p><span><h2 class="__className_a6f35b font-bold text-2xl lg:text-[2.125rem] mb-[18px] font-poppins leading-10" id=h-partynextdoor-is-still-doing-big-things>PartyNextDoor Is Still Doing Big Things</h2></span><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">With this song, Party gives us some sung rap verses, while also transitioning into a full-blown singing voice. Meanwhile, the production is atmospheric and spacey, which is one of his signature traits. It all comes together with a fantastic song that was anthemic in Toronto for quite some time. We can only hope that PND 4 brings about similar vibes.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let us know how you feel about this classic PND song, in the comments section down below.
