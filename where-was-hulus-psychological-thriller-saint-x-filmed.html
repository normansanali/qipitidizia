At the get-go, ‘Saint X’ is a murder mystery of a young woman who, while vacationing with her parents on an idyllic Caribbean island, is raped and then later found murdered.</p><p>The show is adapted from the novel of the same name by Alexis Schaitkin and is developed by Leila Gerstein for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hulu</a>. Despite its harrowing outline, the show’s visuals are scenic to a great extent and give off a cool impression that is easy on the eyes of the viewers. The setting of a beach in the show and the small islands surrounding it add a layer of calm to an otherwise grueling mystery that culminates in the murder of a 19-year-old girl named <a href=# rel>Alison Thomas</a>. In ‘Saint X,’ the sky is mostly painted blue with bright sunshine, which tries its best to offer a respite from the dark alleys of a murder mystery.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>'Saint X': Drake fans go wild as his executive produced show airs its first three episodes on Hulu</a></p><p><a href=# rel>When will 'Saint X' Season 1 Episode 4 air?

In the first three episodes, the story slowly unravels to a point where we see Alison, the victim, interacting with different characters on the beach resort in the past, while in the present timeline, her sister, Emily Thomas, searches for answers about her sister’s murder.</p><h2 class=split>Where was 'Saint X' shot?</h2><p>The show ‘Saint X’ takes place on a fictional Caribbean island where Alison and her family decide to vacation for a while. However, the real identity of the place where the show is shot is mostly in the Dominican Republic, a small, blissful nation known for its lush beaches and exquisite resorts. The show, which is split into two timelines, sees most of the flashbacks take place at the resort in the Dominican Republic, while the present timeline, where Emily is grinding hard to find the truth behind her sister’s murder, takes place in Brooklyn, New York. In the upcoming episodes, the two locations—the Dominican Republic and New York will continue to feature since the story slowly unravels itself in both timelines.</p><p>‘Saint X’ airs every Wednesday exclusively on Hulu.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5iav6Z51pqqZqClocK0ec%2BssJygn6G8qLXCmqNmrJintq24xKtkrJmZo8FuxIyfoKWllZk%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
