Lala who was hanging out with them got the disturbing news that Brock hadn't seen his two kids from a previous relationship for four years now. The nonchalant way Brock said it shook Lala Kent who is a new mother herself. In today's episode, we saw her express that concern in person. She addressed the issue first with Katie Maloney and talked about how Brock and Scheana acted like it was no big deal when in fact it is. Lala was worried about her friend and whether Brock was to be trusted.</p><p>Further into the episode while on a shopping expedition with Scheana for baby clothes she brought up the topic. She worriedly asked Scheana when did she find about Brock's tricky situation with his kids, Scheana told her he was honest right from the start and believes he won't leave their daughter. Lala retorts she hopes so and goes on to say if ever Scheana ever decided to cut ties with him that Brock would fight for Summer Moon (his newborn daughter). Although Scheana assures her Lala isn't convinced. The preview for the next episode shows a big fight and truth to be revealed. This comes amidst her rumored breakup with her husband Randall Emmett who is already a father to someone else's kids as well. Here' what fans thought.</p><p>&nbsp;A fan commented, "I don't get how Lala is judging Brock when she actively pursued someone's father and husband so she could get a leased Range and rides on a PJ #PumpRules #VanderpumpRules". Another user said, " Lala acting like sheâ€™s the one to judge everyone elseâ€™s parenting is the number one problem with new moms. #VPR #vanderpumprules #pumprules". A viewer said, " Wasnâ€™t Lala Randallâ€™s mistress? #PumpRules"&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>A user said, "Lala really didnâ€™t listen to her own advice on this oneâ€¦ #PumpRules". Another fan said,&nbsp; "Lala too busy seeing everyone elseâ€™s signs and she missed her own signs #PumpRules". A user said, " Guess Lala only sees the red flags in other ppls relationshipsâ€¦ #pumprules".</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>Lala too busy seeing everyone elseâ€™s signs and she missed her own signs <a href=#>#PumpRules</a></p>â€” BobbyBravoðŸŒˆ (@BobbyBravoBoy) <a href=#>October 20, 2021</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p>'Vanderpump Rules' airs every Tuesday at 9 ET on Bravo.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRorpGjsaa%2Bz66kqWWiqrmmv4ybqaibm2KxosLInqpmpJGhrm63xKerZquTnbKiusBmnaKfmKl6p63NZqmemZOptrC6jJupmq6fYr%2Bmrcuiq7Jlo528uHnSnpisp55ihg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
