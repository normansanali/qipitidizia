Court documents revealed that she initiated the divorce proceedings in January, eight months before the couple publicly announced their separation on Instagram.</p><p>In the documents, Taylor alleges that Shumpert became increasingly jealous and controlling as her career gained momentum, often discouraging her from working and making her feel the need to diminish her own success for the sake of their marriage.</p><p>Furthermore, Taylor accuses Shumpert of subjecting her to emotional and mental abuse, describing his behavior as extremely narcissistic throughout the majority of their marriage. She also claims that he would display annoyance at public events when photographers requested solo photos of her.</p><p>Despite her efforts to salvage the marriage, Taylor asserts that Shumpert’s behavior became unbearable, characterizing their relationship as an “emotional rollercoaster.”</p><p>While Taylor originally downplayed talk of infidelity in her September announcement, mentioning that it was not a reason for their separation, the divorce filing reportedly includes allegations of infidelity. The legal documents also reveal a previous 2022 divorce filing that Taylor retracted the following day.</p><p>Taylor is currently seeking primary physical custody of their two children, as well as joint legal custody and child support. These details shed light on the underlying issues that contributed to the couple’s separation.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmiqoqaXmr9uwMSymKeZXamuurjOq2SfoZyawG6yzqtknaGmpL%2BksYyfqailXZ66orqMrJ%2BupaCav7V5wKWjnp%2BZo7Rutc2foJ2dnJ7BunnAp5tmpZWjwaK4jJqZrquVZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
