The American actor and producer, known also for playing Shoeless Joe Jackson in Field of Dreams&nbsp;and Tommy Vercetti in the video game Grand Theft Auto: Vice City, passed away <span style=font-size:15px;letter-spacing:-.01em>in his sleep on 26 May 2022 at the age of 67. He is survived by his daughter, Karsen, and his fiancée, Jacy Nittolo.</span></p><p style=text-align:left>Karsen, here, is late Ray’s daughter with ex-wife, actress, and producer, Michelle Grace. And because you are looking to find out more about her, here’s writing telling you just that or even more.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Meet Michelle Grace, Ray Liotta’s Ex-Wife</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Michelle Grace first met Ray Liotta at a baseball game, where her former husband Mark Grace was playing for the Chicago Cubs. They maybe fell for each other around that time before they got married in February 1997. But, IMDB also had it writing that these two met&nbsp;on the set of The Rat Pack in 1998 and that they were married by an Elvis Presley impersonator in Las Vegas. Then again, we have also seen glimpses of their Thailand wedding, and they dressed in St. Pucchi custom design.</p><p style=text-align:left>The year 2004 however saw them divorce and part ways. But, even afterward, according to media outlets, Ray and Michelle only had kind words about each other. Things were easy also because they separated amicably. They were called the “friendly exes”.</p><p style=text-align:left>“Thank God we’re still friends”, Ray once told The Guardian about his ex-wife. He also gushed about how great of a woman she is.</p><p style=text-align:left>Among other things, he liked/respected her when she stayed at his house so that their daughter could see them together. Ray said he and his former wife hoped to give their daughter as much semblance of a family unit as they could.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Michelle Grace And Ray Liotta’s Daughter</strong></h3><p style=text-align:left>Before divorcing, Michelle Grace and Ray Liotta had a daughter and she is <a href=#>Karsen</a>.

Back in the days when he was still alive, Ray had told The Guardian how his whole life is about his daughter. He described how he did not like going too long without seeing her. It was 2007 and he said his life was all about taking Karsen to dance classes and playing with her.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>Michelle Grace’s Husband Now</strong></h3><p>As of 2022, it was not clear if Michelle Grace married again since Ray.</p><p>Ray, on the other hand, was happily engaged to Jacy Nittolo until the time of his death.

She was married to him from 5 November 1988 through 1993. And they had no kids together.</p><p>Mark (Eugene) Grace, so you know, is a former Major League Baseball first baseman who spent 16 seasons with the Chicago Cubs and Arizona Diamondbacks of the National League.

And over the course, she also worked on several projects in which Ray Liotta also starred.</p><p>She was cast in The Rat Pack due to her uncanny resemblance to a young Elizabeth Taylor.</p><h3 style=text-align:left><strong>What Do We Know About Michelle Grace Family?</strong></h3><p>Michelle Grace’s parents are Marsha and George Messer.
