John Smoltz played in MLB from 1988 to 2009, almost entirely with the Atlanta Braves. Along with fellow starting pitchers Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, he helped make the Braves into one of the best teams in the league in the 1990s, highlighted by a World Series championship in 1995. Among his many career accolades, Smoltz won a Cy Young Award, a Silver Slugger Award, and a Roberto Clemente Award. During his baseball career John earned $135 million in total salary. At his peak in 2007 he earned $14 million per season.</p><h2 id=atlanta-mansion><strong>Atlanta Mansion</strong></h2><p>In 2002 John completed construction on an 18,000 square foot mansion set on 19 acres in Milton, Georgia. John listed this estate for <a href=#>sale in October 2019 for $5.2 million</a>. He ultimately accepted $4.6 million in August 2020. Here is a video tour of his former mansion:</p><p></p><h2 id=early-life-education><strong>Early Life and Education</strong></h2><p>John Smoltz was born on May 15, 1967 in Warren, Michigan. As a teenager, he went to Lansing Catholic High School and then Waverly High School, where he played both baseball and basketball. Although Smoltz subsequently committed to playing baseball at Michigan State University, he instead chose to sign a professional contract after being drafted by MLB's Detroit Tigers in the 1985 amateur draft.</p><h2 id=minor-league-career><strong>Minor League Career</strong></h2><p>Beginning his professional career in the minors, Smoltz played for the Class A Lakeland Tigers and then the Class AA Glens Falls Tigers.</p><h2 id=atlanta-braves-1988-1997><strong>Atlanta Braves, 1988-1997</strong></h2><p>Smoltz made his MLB debut in July of 1988 with the Atlanta Braves. He had his breakout season the following year, when he went 12-11 with a 2.94 ERA in 29 starts. Smoltz continued improving over the years, and in 1991 helped the Braves win a close NL West race. In the postseason, he led the Braves to victory in the NLCS, helping the team clinch its first World Series appearance since moving to Atlanta in 1966. Ultimately, the Braves were defeated by the Minnesota Twins in seven games. Smoltz had his best career season yet in 1992, winning 15 regular-season games, leading the NL in strikeouts, and earning MVP honors in the NLCS. Back in the World Series for the second consecutive year, the Braves lost this time to the Toronto Blue Jays in six games.</p><p>In the strike-shortened 1994 season, Smoltz posted a 6-10 record. The following season, he went 12-7 as the Braves made it back to the World Series for the third time in five years. Thanks in large part to the pitching of fellow starters Greg Maddux and Tom Glavine, the Braves won the 1995 World Series by defeating the Cleveland Indians in six games. Smoltz went on to have an incredible 1996 season, going 24-8 with a 2.94 ERA and leading the majors in both wins and strikeouts. He continued to pitch exceptionally in the postseason, helping the Braves return to the World Series. This time, the team fell to the New York Yankees. For the 1996 season, Smoltz won the NL Cy Young Award. Although his 1997 season wasn't quite as strong, he managed to win a Silver Slugger Award for his batting.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-164262 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/12/GettyImages-55880882.jpg alt width=594 height=409 sizes="(max-width: 594px) 100vw, 594px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-164262 class=wp-caption-text>Brian Bahr / Getty Images</p><h2 id=atlanta-braves-1998-2008><strong>Atlanta Braves, 1998-2008</strong></h2><p>Smoltz continued to pitch well in both 1998 and 1999, but missed numerous starts due to time on the disabled list. Prior to the 2000 season, he underwent Tommy John surgery, causing him to miss the whole year. Still unable to function as an effective starter in 2001, he moved to the bullpen and became the Braves' closer. In his first full season as a closer in 2002, Smoltz set a new NL record with 55 saves and won the Rolaids Relief Man Award. Despite being hampered by injuries in 2003, he recorded 45 saves with a 1.12 ERA. In the 2004 season, Smoltz broke Gene Garber's franchise record of 141 career saves. After three years serving as a closer, Smoltz returned to the Braves' starting rotation in the 2005 season. He finished that season with a 14-7 record and a 3.06 ERA as the Braves reached the NLDS, where they lost to the Houston Astros. For the 2005 season, Smoltz won the Roberto Clemente Award.</p><p>In the 2006 season, Smoltz went 16-9 with a 3.49 ERA. He tied with three other pitchers that year for most wins in the NL. In 2007, Smoltz agreed to a contract extension with the Braves. He went on to have a memorable season, facing his former Braves teammates Maddux and Glavine on numerous occasions and setting the Braves strikeout record with his 2,913th career strikeout. Smoltz finished the 2007 season with a 14-8 record and a 3.11 ERA. He achieved another milestone in 2008 when he reached 3,000 career strikeouts, making him the 16th MLB pitcher to reach that number. Less than a week after that, however, Smoltz was placed on the disabled list with an inflamed right shoulder. After coming off the disabled list in early June, he blew his first save opportunity in three years, and was soon placed back on the disabled list. Smoltz subsequently had shoulder surgery, ending his season and ultimately his tenure with the Braves.</p><h2 id=boston-red-sox><strong>Boston Red Sox</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>In early 2009, Smoltz signed a one-year contract with the Boston Red Sox. However, he had a poor start to the season, and following a 13-6 loss to the Yankees in August he was designated for assignment. Smoltz was offered a minor league contract by the Red Sox, but he rejected it and was ultimately released by the team.</p><h2 id=st-louis-cardinals><strong>St. Louis Cardinals</strong></h2><p>After being released by the Red Sox, Smoltz signed with the St. Louis Cardinals. In his first game with the team, a victory over the San Diego Padres, he set a franchise record by striking out seven consecutive batters. It would be his only win with the Cardinals, however, as he finished the season with a 1-3 record and a 4.26 ERA. In the NLDS, the team was swept by the Los Angeles Dodgers.</p><h2 id=sportscasting-career><strong>Sportscasting Career</strong></h2><p>In 2008 and 2010, Smoltz was a color analyst for Braves games on Peachtree TV. Later, in 2014, he became an analyst for Fox Sports. Smoltz also did analysis and color commentary for the MLB Network. However, he was forced to end his in-studio work with the MLB Network when he refused to receive the COVID-19 vaccine.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Smoltz married his first wife, Dyan Struble, in 1991. They had four children before divorcing in 2007. Two years after that, Smoltz wed Kathryn Darden. The couple resides in Alpharetta, Georgia.</p><p>Smoltz is a golfer, and is good friends with golf star <a href=# title="Tiger Woods Net Worth">Tiger Woods</a>. He plays annually in the American Century Championship, a celebrity golf tournament at Edgewood Tahoe Resort. Smoltz also bowls and plays the accordion.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuu6bA1qipraBemLyue9GimqGdo6l6osDHpZytnaNkv6qvx56qrWWSlsCmrsClo2iin527br%2FMqKOtsl2jsrV51qipraBf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
