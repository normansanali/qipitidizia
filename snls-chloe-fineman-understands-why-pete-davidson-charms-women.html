And I <a href=#>remember my first year</a> [on&nbsp;<i>SNL</i>], going to all my girlfriends and being like, ‘I get it’ [after I met him]. ”</p><p class=p1>Fineman <a href=#>herself has not romanced her former costar</a> — who <a href=#>left the show after season 47 last year</a> —&nbsp;but she does have “friends who have dated” the&nbsp;<i>King of Staten Island&nbsp;</i>actor, and they all “report back nice things.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/SNLs-Chloe-Fineman-Understands-Why-Deeply-Charming-Pete-Davidson-Is-Popular-With-Women-Inline.jpg><p class=p1>In addition to <a href=#>his thriving comedy career</a>, Davidson’s love lives have made headlines as he’s been linked to the likes of <a href=#><strong>Cazzie David</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kate Beckinsale</strong></a>,<a href=#> <strong>Kaia Gerber</strong> </a>and&nbsp;<a href=#><i>Bridgerton</i></a>’s<a href=#><strong> Phoebe Dynevor</strong></a> through the years. The New York native <a href=#>was engaged to Grande, 29, between June and October 2018</a>, who notably <a href=#>gushed about the impressive girth of her then-fiancé’s penis</a>. Davidson quickly became an unlikely sex symbol, <a href=#>known for his “big dick energy.”</a></p><p class=p1>“I don’t hate it,” he quipped to&nbsp;<i>Variety</i>&nbsp;in August 2018. “I’m <a href=#>just really, really happy</a>, and if that means I have big dick energy, then sick. My favorite thing was my mom was like, ‘Peter, they’re saying you had a big penis just like your father.’ What the f–k!”</p><p class=p1>Following his split from the&nbsp;<i>Victorious&nbsp;</i>alum — who has since married <a href=#><strong>Dalton Gomez</strong></a> — Davidson<a href=#> eventually moved on with the 42-year-old Skims mogul</a>. The&nbsp;<i>Meet Cute&nbsp;</i>star initially connected with Kardashian <a href=#>during her October 2021&nbsp;<i>SNL&nbsp;</i>hosting debut</a>, where they shared a sweet stage kiss.</p><p class=p1>“He seems super charming, he’s vulnerable, he’s lovely, his fingernail polish is awesome,” Ratajkowski, 31, gushed <a href=#>during a November 2021 appearance on&nbsp;</a><i><a href=#>Late Night With Seth Meyers</a>&nbsp;</i>about Davidson’s appeal as a boyfriend amid his romance with the reality TV star. “Like, he looks good, he’s great. … I&nbsp;think Pete’s got the height. Obviously, women find him very attractive [and he has a] good relationship with his mother.”</p><p class=p1>The&nbsp;<i>I Feel Pretty&nbsp;</i>actress’ comments came less than one year before <a href=#>Davidson and Kardashian’s August split</a>. He <a href=#>has since moved on with&nbsp;Ratajkowski</a>, which&nbsp;<i>Us Weekly&nbsp;</i>exclusively confirmed last month.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>“Pete and Emily just dig each other,” a source <a href=#>exclusively told&nbsp;<i>Us&nbsp;</i>in November</a>&nbsp;of the new pair’s “fun” romance. “[They] find the vibe they have very easy and free-flowing. [There’s] just a lot of fun and a chance to cut loose and see where it leads. There’s no doubt Pete loves a challenge and he’s certainly met his intellectual match in Emily.”</p><p class=p1>While neither Davidson nor the&nbsp;<i>My Body&nbsp;</i>author have addressed their connection, they <a href=#>made their public debut at the November 27 New York Knicks game</a> and were all smiles in their courtside seats.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasppyoeqS0y6icZp6Zo7Kurc1mrKeclafAta3Nnapmr5iuerGx055knZmmnrG0u81mmqGZoqLAbsPOppynZw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
