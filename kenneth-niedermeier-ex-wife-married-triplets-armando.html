The duo first appeared on the show back in 2020, got married, and was going strong even a year later. But lately, there was a rumor going on that Kenneth was already married and had an ex-wife.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Thus, here we are to clear things up. Also, on the way get to know all about Kenneth’s triplets.</span></p><h3><b>Does Kenneth Niedermeier Have An Ex-Wife? Was He Even Married?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>No, Kenneth Niedermeier didn’t have an ex-wife. Armando Rubio is his first spouse, whom he married on </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> on May 22, 2021.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>So, what was the rumor all about? In case you don’t know, Kenneth has four children and even two grandchildren. This leads viewers to believe that those kids were Kenneth’s offspring from his previous wife (and some reports even said that it was). Moreover, his age also played a big factor for many to believe that the rumor was true.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>But Kenneth never married his baby mother. </span><span style=font-weight:400>Kenneth and his rumored “ex-wife” were only just good friends.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Back in the 80s, gay men weren’t allowed to have children. To conceive one, they had to be married! “So, nothing was going to stop me. A friend of mine offered to have a child for me so we had to fake being married and no, I didn’t ‘tap’ that. It was all medical,” he shared.</span></p><h3><b>What Is Kenneth Niedermeier’s Baby Mother’s Name?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kenneth Niedermeier wanted his baby mother to be anonymous and so did she. Thus, her name perhaps might never come to light. The only information we have about Kenneth’s baby mother is that she was his good friend, and they never were in a relationship.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>To recall, “I didn’t ‘tap’ that,” Kenneth remarked.</span></p><h3><b>Who Are Kenneth Niedermeier’s Triplets?</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kenneth Niedermeier has four kids via IVF — a son named Bryson (26), and triplet daughters Taylor, Cassidy, and Madison, all aged 23, as of 2021.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He raised the children all on his own and loved them dearly. “I always wanted to be a father, it was my main goal in life.

As of 2021, she lived in Florida with her husband Serrano Joshua and their kid Julian Joshua.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400><strong>Madison:</strong> She cherished a single life in Saint Petersburg, Florida, as of 2021.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>All of his kids except Madison and grandson Cooper (who was 3 and a half then) had moved out before Kenneth shifted to Mexico to be with his wife.</span></p><p><b>Did you know: </b><span style=font-weight:400>Cassidy was inspired to open the coffee shop on her trip with Kenneth to Mexico.</span></p><h3><b>Kenneth Niedermeier And Armando Rubio’s Relationship</b></h3><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kenneth Niedermeier first met his future husband Armando on a Facebook support group for gay dads in 2020. Since the duo both carried a tragic past, they immediately clicked. And with a bit of drama but a lot of love over </span><i><span style=font-weight:400>90 Day Fiancé: The Other Way</span></i><span style=font-weight:400> season 2, Kenneth pulled out a ring and asked Armando to marry him in Nov 2020.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>The couple went on to tie a knot on May 22, 2021.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>As of Nov 2021, they were happily married and lived together in Mexico, with Armando’s daughter, Hanna.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>Before marrying Armando, Kenneth has already has had two long-term relationships.</span></p><h3><b>Related FAQs</b></h3><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>How Old Is Kenneth Niedermeier?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kenneth Niedermeier was 59 years of age in 2021.</span></p><p><span style=font-weight:400>He celebrates his birthday on June 22 and is of the Cancer zodiac.</span></p><ul><li style=font-weight:400><h4><b>Who Are Kenneth Niedermeier’s Parents And Siblings?</b></h4></li></ul><p><span style=font-weight:400>Kenneth was born to their parents, Norman and Mary Ann Niedermeier.
