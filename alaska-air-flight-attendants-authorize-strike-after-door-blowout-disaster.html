With six recently closed labor deals at the company and a tentative agreement reached in January for a new contract for our technicians, we’re hopeful to do the same for our flight attendants as soon as possible.”</p><p>The Post has sought comment from AFA-CWA.</p><p>Last month, budget-friendly <a href=#>Southwest approved a new labor agreement</a> that offered a roughly 50% pay raise over a five-year period to about 11,000 pilots affiliated with the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association, which also pushed for better retirement benefits, disability insurance, and revised scheduling processes.</p><p>Pilots at the Dallas-based carrier will get a&nbsp;29.15% pay raise&nbsp;immediately and a hike of 4% each in 2025, 2026, and 2027.
