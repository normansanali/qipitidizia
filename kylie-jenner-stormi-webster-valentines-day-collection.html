Jenner low-key announced the news on her brand's Instagram feed, sharing a behind-the-scenes shot of Stormi and a few members of the Kylie Cosmetics team looking over artwork options for the collection's packaging.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"First collaboration of 2020 coming soon ðŸ’œðŸ’—," she captioned the post.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Judging from what we can see in the photo, the collection seems to be inspired by the mother and daughter's mutual love of butterflies. In the photo, the toddler is playing with a lip gloss applicator, and underneath her arm, there's a drawing of violet and butterfly Lip Kit packaging featuring her name across the front in purple glitter â€” and a picture of a nine-pan eyeshadow palette.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While butterflies are an unexpected theme for a Valentine's Day collection, which often feature red and pink hearts and lips, the insect also seems to hold a special meaning for Jenner and Stormi's father, Travis Scott. Both parents have matching butterfly tattoos, Jenner has also been photographed wearing butterfly jewelry and she even decorated Stormi's nursery with them. Fans have even speculated that the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>toddler's name</a> was inspired by the butterfly effect, which ironically is the name of one of her dad's songs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Kris Jenner Gave Stormi the Sweetest, Most Sentimental Christmas Gift</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This isn't the only time Jenner has created Kylie Cosmetics collections with her family members. She's previously collaborated with Kim, KhloÃ©, Kourtney, and Kris. However, this Valentine's Day collection is likely the first of many big launches for her brand in 2020. At the tail end of 2019, Jenner <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>sold a $600 million stake</a> of Kylie Cosmetics to cosmetics conglomerate Coty Inc.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">But in terms of this line, Jenner hasn't announced the collaboration's final product lineup or the release date, but seeing as Stormi's second birthday is Feb. 1, we're guessing it will drop around then.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57zZ6urGebrrmqsYyjnKemlad6tMDOq6SiZaear7TAxKtkr5mcmru1tc2eqmacka56pLvLpZycrJmkuw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
