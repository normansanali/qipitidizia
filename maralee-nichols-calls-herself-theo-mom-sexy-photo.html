Khloe and Tristian <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>conceived via a surrogate</a> in Nov. 2021, without Khloe knowing <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Maralee was already in a paternity battle</a> with Tristan. Khloe found out about Tristan and Maralee’s relationship with the rest of the world the following month.</p><p id=content-paragraph-6>Tristan’s new cheating scandal with Khloe played out on the&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>season finale </a>of Hulu’s<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> The Kardashians</a>, which offered a look at Khloe’s initial reaction.&nbsp;“A courtesy would be not doing it. But fine — if you do — you’re not even going to give me a f—king heads up before the rest of the world?” the Good American founder said upon learning that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Tristan had betrayed her trust</a> again. “It’s just an additional slap in my face. It’s humiliating. I’m embarrassed. I would prefer to be alone than around people.”</p><p id=content-paragraph-7>However, it appears that Khloe has since accepted the heartbreak and has moved on. In fact, a source close to the youngest Kardashian sister confirmed to <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> in June that Khloe began to open up her heart again. “Khloe definitely considers herself single at the moment. However, she has been casually dating and flirting with someone Kim hooked her up with,” a source <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>EXCLUSIVELY revealed to <strong>HL</strong></a>. “It’s not serious at all and she doesn’t want to put anything out there in the public at this point. They just started talking, texting, FaceTiming, etc., and hanging out a few weeks ago but Khloe doesn’t want to put any pressure on things so early on. She’s open to dating but she’s not actively looking or anything like that.” However, shortly after the news of Khloe’s new baby boy — which is expected to be born any day — broke, another source told <strong>HL&nbsp;</strong>that <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Khloe is focusing on welcoming her new child</a>, rather than her love life, at the moment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Maralee-Nichols-tristan-thompson-khloe-kardashian-ss-post1.jpg><p id=content-paragraph-8>On the other hand, Tristan appears to be working on his romance in Greece. He was spotted on July 17 <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>walking hand-in-hand with a mystery woman</a> after a night out clubbing at Bonbonniere, per TMZ. The PDA occurred at 5 am, and Tristan donned a festive floral button-down, while the woman wore a curve-hugging orange dress. Two days later, he was<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link> photographed smiling with two more mystery women</a> at a glamorous outdoor restaurant in Mykonos.</p><p id=content-paragraph-9>Amid Tristan’s partying in Greece, a KarJenner source confirmed that Khloe is done letting anything Tristan does upset her. “She’s been telling people she doesn’t care,&nbsp;<a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>they’re not together</a>&nbsp;and he can do what he wants. It’s hard for her family not to be upset on her behalf, they’re very protective, but as far as&nbsp;<span class=markxlqgg7rqb data-markjs=true data-ogac data-ogab data-ogsc data-ogsb>Khloe</span> is concerned all that really matters to her is the relationship that Tristan has with their kids,” the insider <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>told <strong>HollywoodLife</strong> EXCLUSIVELY</a>. “She’s got zero interest in going backward with him and says she’s moved on, so he can do whatever he wants. Still, her sisters think that it is inconsiderate of him to be bar hopping around the globe right now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpiZH14e5FpZqaZopa5prGMp6CcoJ%2BhwG6vwKWjrGWYmr%2B0scufZK2glaR6rrvMZqqesKlivam706hm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
