Well, not sort of,” the Grammy winner says of Kudelka. “We’ve known each other for so long. We’re such good friends, and we still really enjoy working together. He has his own style of movement. It complements the way that I like to move on stage. It’s crisp without being, like, showboaty.”</p><p>The video is set to a selection of hits from Timberlake’s career, including “Mirrors,” “SexyBack,” “Can’t Stop the Feeling!” and his new single “Filthy.” It is unclear if these songs will be performed at the Super Bowl or if they were simply dubbed over the actual audio from the rehearsal sessions.</p><p></p><p>“Unity, that’s all we’re gonna try to do,” the former ‘Nsync member explains. “I don’t worry about if things go wrong because perfection is the death of greatness. … I think if everything spawns off [having a good time], I think it’ll be fine.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Timberlake’s highly anticipated fourth album, <a href=#>Man of the Woods</a>, will be released on Friday, February 2.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/justin-timberlake-rehearsal.jpg><p>The New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles will face off at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis for Super Bowl LII, which airs on NBC on Sunday, February 4, at 6:30 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKGuq6Seu27AyKaZnqqclrimedGen56ZoqiytHnCoaarnZ%2Bcv6K8x7Jkn6eiYsC2vMSrZJunp6F6t7XDnqZo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
