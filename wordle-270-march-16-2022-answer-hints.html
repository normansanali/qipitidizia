However, if players are stuck on their last try and don’t want to sacrifice their streak, they could use some hints to guess today’s answer. While Wordle does give visual clues to players, many times, especially for today’s answer, it isn’t enough to point players in the right direction. Since players have to guess the correct answer in six tries or less, today’s Wordle answer could throw people off due to the number of words that could be used.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true><a href=#>Wordle’s rules are easy to understand</a> once players know the basics of these visual clues. With each five-letter word guess, the game responds by changing the color of a box depending on whether the letter is being used in today’s answer. For example, if a box’s color changes to green, that means the letter in that box is being used in today’s Wordle answer and is in the right spot. However, if the box’s color turns yellow, that means the letter is being used in today’s answer but isn’t in the right place. Finally, if the box’s color remains unchanged, that means the letter is not being used anywhere in today’s Wordle answer.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag>SCREENRANT VIDEO OF THE DAY</strong></p><p><span class=related-single data-preserver-spaces=true>Related: <a href=#>Best Wordle Word Combos To Start With</a></span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Once players are done attempting the Wordle puzzle, they can share their results with the rest of the world on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter. Players can do so by clicking on the “Share” button, which copies a set of color emoji boxes (green and yellow) and the number of attempts it took the player to guess the answer. What’s cool is that these boxes can be understood by other players who know the rules and already know <a href=#>today’s Wordle answer</a>. It’s worth pointing out that these emojis do not spoil the answer for others as they only represent the correct and incorrect usage of letters.</span></p><h2><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Wordle’s March 16, 2022 (#270) Hints & Answers</span></h2><figure class=item-img></figure><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Some players like to get hints about today’s Wordle anger that helps them solve today’s puzzle.
