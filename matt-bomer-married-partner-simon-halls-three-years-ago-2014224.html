The Magic Mike actor revealed in this month’s issue of <a href=# rel=noopener>Details</a> magazine that he’s been married to partner<strong> Simon Halls </strong>for the past three years.</p><p>Discussing his latest role in <strong>Ryan Murphy’s</strong> TV movie adaptation of The Normal Heart, in which he plays a gay man dying of AIDS during the early days of the epidemic, the actor acknowledges the original play’s writer <strong>Larry Kramer </strong>for helping pave the way for gay rights.</p><p>“I wouldn’t have a lot of the rights I have today if it wasn’t for people like Larry,” Bomer told the mag. One of those rights, of course, is same sex marriage. The mag reveals Bomer, who has 6-year-old twin sons and an 8-year-old son with Halls, married the Hollywood publicist back in 2011.</p><img decoding=async width=467 height=635 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/Matt-Bomer-Details-Cover-467.jpg alt="Matt Bomer Details Cover" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Bomer, who came out in 2012 while accepting an award at the Desert AIDS Project’s Steve Chase Humanitarian Awards, said that he first read The Normal Heart when he was in high school. Upon hearing about the project, he “just wanted to be involved …in some capacity.”</p><p>“At [the time when I read it], I was clueless and obviously in a different place in relation to my sexuality,” he admitted. “I was in romantic relationships with girls—whatever that means at 14. And it completely rocked my world…It’s just an amazing call to arms.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Blue Collar actor had to lose a shocking 40 pounds for the role, which he accomplished with the help of doctors and a 14-day alkalized-water, juice, tea and enzyme <a href=# data-link=1>cleanse</a>. Bomer also sought advice from Magic Mike co-star <strong><a href=# rel=noopener>Matthew McConaughey</a></strong>, who similarly shed almost 50 pounds to play AIDS activist in the Oscar-nominated drama Dallas Buyers Club.</p><p>“He called me and walked me through what he did,” Bomer recalls of the Academy Award winner’s help. “It was very generous, but I took a slightly different path.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGammaSpeqO7zJ6pZqWRp7%2BqscNmp5qqpKOys3nSoqSopl2drq240maroaqVmnq6scCrqmaZl6R6c3yQbWlrbF8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
