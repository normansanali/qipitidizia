Like a sculptor, you sculpt your body daily with a strict diet and intense workouts. People get into bodybuilding for various reasons. To some, it is because of aesthetic reasons, while to some, it is due to health reasons.</p><p>However, the up-and-coming bodybuilder<strong>&nbsp;Hunter Labrada </strong>got into bodybuilding because he wanted to do well on the gridiron. Hunter is the son of IFBB Hall of Famer <strong>Lee Labrada</strong>.<span>&nbsp;</span>Hence, this article revolves around the life of Hunter and will discuss his career as a bodybuilder and his father’s influence in doing so.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Journey_To_Bodybuilding></span>Journey To Bodybuilding<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>The famous American bodybuilder, </span><b>Hunter Labrada</b><span>, was born on May 17, 1992. His mother is <strong>Robin Labrada</strong>, and his father is Lee Labrada. Hunter Labrador’s father needs no introduction to the bodybuilding industry. Mr. Lee was the winner of Mr. Universe in 1985 and was placed top 4 for seven consecutive years in Mr. Olympia.</span></p><p>Hunter was only 2 when his father retired. He never pushed Hunter to pursue the same career as his but always motivated him to excel at whatever he did. It wasn’t Hunter’s first dream to pursue a career in bodybuilding. Initially, he wanted to play football. Unfortunately, his dreams came to a halt after he suffered a few serious injuries. During high school, Hunter had three concussions. He had fractured his hip, broken his arm, and dislocated his shoulders.</p><p>If Hunter had continued to play football for another four years in college, he would most likely suffer some major injuries. And if that happened, bodybuilding would be off the table for Hunter Labrada. That is why he quit football and pursued bodybuilding. Hunter’s affinity towards bodybuilding grew in his late teens. Hunter Labrada’s father, Lee Labrada, IFBB Hall of Famer, wanted him to focus on <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">football instead</a> of bodybuilding. But not everything goes according to plan.</p><p>At first, Lee wasn’t happy about Hunter’s decision. But now, seeing his son’s passion come to fruition, Lee is delighted. Hunter Labrada was off to a great start and first got the <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">attention</a> after winning the 2020 Tampa Pro. Hunter has also won numerous competitions, including NPC Junior USA Championship, NPC Europa Dallas, and NPC National Championship in 2018. Another famous bodybuilder, <strong><a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a></strong>‘s daughter, is an author.<i><span>&nbsp;</span></i></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Following_His_Fathers_Footsteps></span>Following His Father’s Footsteps<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Hunter’s father, Lee Labrada, known as “</span><b>Mass with the Class,”</b><span> is a bodybuilding legend in his own right. He has won so many medals that he was inducted into the IFBB Pro-Bodybuilding Hall of Fame in 2004. The former Mr. Universe holds a total of twenty-two professional construction titles. Additionally, Mr. Lee has reached the top four in Olympia six times. Now, Lee Labrada’s son Hunter Labrada is on the pursuit to carry on his father’s legacy.</span></p><p>The second-generation bodybuilder, Hunter also debuted in Mr. Olympia in 2020 and finished in <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">eighth position</a>. To fall under the top 10 positions in the first year was quite an achievement. So Hunter participated the following year and came fourth. Each year, Hunter was nearer to winning the Mr. Olympia title. In his third year of Mr. Olympia, Hunter finished in seventh place.</p><p>The bodybuilder was disappointed with the result but promised to <a href=# data-wpel-link=external rel="nofollow external noopener noreferrer">come out better</a> in 2023. To Hunter, his father is the major source of inspiration and his number one believer. Hunter Labrada’s father, Lee Labrada, is optimistic that his son could win the title someday.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ:<a href=# data-wpel-link=internal> Interesting Facts About Netflix’s New Show ‘Wednesday’</a></strong></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Hunter_Labradas_Love_Life></span>Hunter Labrada’s Love Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><span>Hunter Labrada’s love life is just as flourishing as his career.
