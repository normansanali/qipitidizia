Able to walk and talk by her first birthday, at school she "drove everybody crazy because I had adult questions and wanted adult answers".</p><p id=ergcMhghCI data-wc=75>After graduating from high school, by which time she had started to land the top prize in beauty pageants, Sharon won a writing scholarship to the University of Pennsylvania. There she majored in creative writing and fine arts, but her real love was acting. As a child she performed plays in her parents' garage to entertain the neighbours, and used her beauty pageant money to hire an acting coach to help her hone her craft.</p><h2>Start of career</h2><p id=exwjMMq5aU data-wc=48>In 1977, Sharon moved to New York, where she signed with the Ford agency and became one of the firm's top models, most memorably in the Charlie perfume ads. Her career slowed down, however, after an injury incurred while horse-riding left her with a scar on her neck.</p><p id=eicJ10RjLP data-wc=37>Her movie break came just three years later, when Woody Allen cast her in <i>Stardust Memories.</i> It was only a fleeting appearance, but it was a start. Her career took a remarkably long time to germinate, however.</p><p id=eJ7MG9x439M data-wc=35>Most of the 80s was taken up with a series of forgettable parts, including Richard Chamberlain-vehicle <i>King Solomon's Mines.</i> She later described her performance in the film as "a bad hairdo running through a jungle".</p><h2>Continuing career and success</h2><p id=expsJuT7hoe data-wc=66>It wasn't until she played <a aria-label="Biography of Arnold Schwarzenegger" class=hm-link href=#>Arnold Schwarzenegger</a><strong>'s</strong> wife in <i>Total Recall,</i> that Hollywood really started to sit up and take notice. And her decision to pose nude for <i>Playboy</i> magazine at the age of 32 can't have done any harm either. By the time she was cast in the role of Catherine Tramell in 1992's <i>Basic Instinct,</i> she was well and truly on the Tinseltown radar.</p><p id=eANs5GXBdi3 data-wc=73>Once Sharon had shored up her bankability with a couple of conventional movies including romantic thriller <i>Sliver,</i> and <i>The Specialist,</i> in which she shared a shower scene with Sylvester Stallone, she turned her hand to producing. The Western <i>The Quick And The Dead</i> had her starring as a female gunfighter alongside <a aria-label="Biography of Gene Hackman" class=hm-link href=#>Gene Hackman</a> and <a aria-label="Biography of Leonardo DiCaprio" class=hm-link href=#>Leonardo DiCaprio</a>. When the project ran into difficulties she paid half of Leo's wages out of her own salary.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/8ff6e60c6489-sharon-stone-basic-instinct.jpg><p id=eKUTpB2UQxI data-wc=46>The movie that put her on the map as a serious actress was Martin Scorsese's classic gangster-flick <i>Casino.</i> As mobster's moll Ginger, Sharon eclipsed everyone including the film's stunning 60s and 70s period clothing winning a Golden Globe Award and an Oscar nomination for her performance.</p><p id=eip8JnaDva4 data-wc=46>Hollywood is a place obsessed by youth and for most actresses, as the years roll on, the parts dry up. But Sharon Stone remains in the limelight she has, after all, received four Golden Globe nominations, including one in 1999 for her performance in <i>The Muse.</i></p><p id=eelgolbcko data-wc=45>It's not just on the big screen where Sharon has found success, as the actress won an Emmy Award for her guest role in back in 2004, where she played Sheila Carlisle, an attorney who believed she was able to speak to God.</p><h2>Personal life</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5562c13f6aaf-sharon-stone-an-unforgettable-evening.jpg><p id=e0YAp62w1qE data-wc=48>After her 1984 marriage to TV producer Michael Greenburg came to an end, she found love again with San Francisco newspaperman Phil Bronstein, marrying him in 1998. Two years later the couple adopted a baby boy, Roan Joseph Bronstein, but their relationship didn't last they divorced in 2005.</p><p id=eMKvzCeb8-a data-wc=54>As a single mum Sharon went onto adopt two more boys - Laird Vonne Stone in 2005 and Quinn Kelly the following year. When asked in 2009 how she copes on her own, the actress said: "I multi-task. I have more love, help, friendship and kindness than at any other time in my life".</p><h2>Health</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/47b17f5928bc-sharon-stone-fundraiser.jpg><p id=eymrn51c_5 data-wc=63>In September 2001 Sharon suffered a major health scare when she was diagnosed with an aneurysm on the brain. She has since been given the all clear. Sharon says her illness and the time off afterwards had a silver lining. "I don't have wants and desires now the way that I did before," she says. "I have more of a sense of gratitude."</p><p id=ew-gKUm3yK data-wc=33>Since then the actress has dedicated much of her time to philanthropic works. She is a passionate AIDS activist, and is honorary chair of AmFAR, the high-profile charity formerly headed by <a aria-label="Biography of Elizabeth Taylor" class=hm-link href=#>Elizabeth Taylor</a>.</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_lag0e70>More Profiles:</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9ybWBkwKmt0ailZqukpLumew%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
