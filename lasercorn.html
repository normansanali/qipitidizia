Before this, he had also worked as a lifeguard.</li><li>As a young child, he had wanted to be a race car driver. He later switched his ambitions after watching the 1993 science-fiction film Jurassic Park and dreamed of being an archaeologist.</li><li>His biggest pet peeve is being bombarded with modern millennial slang that keeps expanding and evolving all the time.</li><li>He revealed in an interview that he wished he had spelled his moniker Lasercorn with a ‘z’ instead of an ‘s’ as he felt that would have been much cooler.</li><li>From June 2014 to 2017, his hair was dyed orange. He had to do so after he lost a video game challenge against YouTuber and gamer Sohinki. The bet was that he would have to keep the dyed hair for a month but he kept it on for more than 2 years as he said that he was too lazy to remove the dye.</li><p>Featured Image by Lasercorn / Instagram</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiglZa5tbTYnJylnZJjsLC5jqWYrJ2imLyzuo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
