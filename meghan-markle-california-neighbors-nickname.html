Now, Meghan, who resides in Montecito, California, with her husband <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Prince Harry</a> and their two children, Archie and Lilibet, has a new moniker graciously assigned to her by her SoCal neighbors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to British publication <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Closer</a>, the duchess has been dubbed the "Princess of Montecito," though the royals live a relatively normal life. A source told the outlet that to ensure privacy, Meghan will even "call ahead [to restaurants] and request a table that is completely secluded." She even "loves driving around L.A. to go to the same hiking trails that she used to visit back in the day, well off the beaten track," the insider added. "Often, she'll head off, just herself and the dogs, which gives her time to reflect."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Despite staying semi under-the-radar, Meghan maintains a social life with her A-list friends. "She spends a fair amount of time at Oprah's palatial house, where they'll kick back with her closest friend, Gayle King, and talk about everything from Meghan's future plans to what's going on back in the U.K. and how Harry's coping with everything," the source says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though the report notes that Harry acts more as the stay-at-home dad, "up at the crack of dawn getting the kids fed, washed, and dressed," the source told Closer. "Meghan's often very busy on business Zoom calls, or nipping into L.A. for meetings, which Harry often chauffeurs her to. Then, he's back to the kids as soon as possible, because he doesn't like leaving them with nannies."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">And what about her political ambitions? Well, the source seems to think that Harry would happily cheer her on from the sidelines. "With all this speculation around her political career ambitions, everyone thinks Harry would be happy at the idea of being first gentleman if she accomplishes her long-term goal."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e8yenqGZnmK6or7KpZxopZWctaK6jKaYq6Ocmnqkrcuinaiqnp6ubrrEop6hmp%2BnwG66yJyip5mdmg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
