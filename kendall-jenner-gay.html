But it fizzled out.

Kendall is great, and naturally, with her being good friends with Gigi and with Joe and Gigi dating, there are times we’ll be in the same place and we all hang out.”</p><p>She was linked to basketball player <a href=#>Jordan Clarkson</a> in 2016 but again nothing came out of this relationship. In August of the same year, numerous reports made headlines that Kendall is with <a href=#>A$AP Rocky.</a> But there was probably nothing there either.</p><p>Later, Kendall got close to NBA player&nbsp;<a href=#>Blake Griffin</a> in the year 2017. She was accused of breaking his family with his wife <a href=#>Brynn Cameron</a> and children.</p><p>In 2018, she was photographed kissing the little brother of Gigi and <a href=#>Bella Hadid</a>, <a href=#>Anwar Hadid</a>.

An insider revealed that the couple was enjoying themselves and had a great time there. This too has raised doubts in the minds of her fans about her sexuality. Why should a straight person visit a gay bar?</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=%E2%80%98I_am_not_gay_says_the_model></span>‘I am not gay,&nbsp; says the model<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In March 2018, Kendall spoke to Vogue and set the record straight about her suspected sexuality. Explaining the probable reason for the doubts in the minds of her fans, she said:</p><p>“I think it’s because I’m not like all my other sisters, who are like, ‘Here’s me and my boyfriend!’ So it was a thing for a minute because no one ever saw me with a guy. I would always go that extra mile to be low-key with guys, sneaking around all the time. You don’t want to, like, look crazy.” However, never say never! “I don’t think I have a bisexual or gay bone in my body, but I don’t know! Who knows?! I’m all down for experience—not against it whatsoever—but I’ve never been there before.”&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/marriedbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Kendall-1.jpg><p>So there was an element at that time too that there is some chance of gay sexuality in her. She added:</p><p>“Also, I know I have kind of a . . . male energy? But I don’t want to say that wrong, because I’m not transgender or anything. But I have a tough energy. I move differently. But to answer your question: I’m not gay. I have literally nothing to hide. I would never hide something like that.”&nbsp;</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Short_bio_on_Kendall_Jenner></span>Short bio on Kendall Jenner<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Kendall Jenner is a famous fashion model and television personality in America.
