The ten-song effort is a testament to many things: the prominence of the dark, druggy, Atlanta trap sound; <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Future</a>'s work ethic; <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Drake</a>'s diversity. The album is one of the more surprising releases in recent history, and recent history has almost exclusively boasted albums that&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">were (at least trying to be) a surprise.</a></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Future and Drake have very different styles, but it works out together. Most will agree that the record has more of a Future sound to it, and they're correct. Drake told <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">Rolling Stone</a>, "I went to Atlanta for six days a couple weeks ago with the hopes of doing some songs with Future, and when you get around Future, it’s like a vortex. That guy can outwork anybody right now […] It’s tough to see someone do four, five songs in one night and not try to match it."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">We're happy Drake tried to match it, and now we have an album by two of 2015's hottest artists. Naturally, we had to pin them against each other, though. Who had the better verse? Let's discuss.</p><p><br><h2>Drake & Future - Digital Dash</h2></p><p>Who Had The Better Verse: Drake Vs. Future</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Over a tough <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Metro Boomin</a> beat, Future kicks off the tape with&nbsp;the type of banter you'd expect. "My dope in the bushes, I know how to cook it," he quasi-mumbles as to gather his bearings. Things really get going right around the time when the beat switches, and he unleashes some of his finer lines of the verse: "I'm smokin' that pack on muddy /&nbsp;Taliban on these hoes /&nbsp;Give a Xan to these hoes /&nbsp;Got em playing with they nose /&nbsp;I sleep on the beach off the avenue /&nbsp;I came to your city with revenue /&nbsp;I put in work it was evident."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Drake patiently waits his turn, taking&nbsp;2:32 for him&nbsp;to hop in with the same line Future hit us with, "These bitches be naggin' the kid." Drizzy never fully catches the flow, stumbling with "And we just keep servin' and servin' again and again and again and again," early on before ending with, "And I got the, I got the, I got the, I got the, I..." It leaves us wanting a little more.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Winner: Future</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Your Vote:</strong></p><p><h2>Drake & Future - Big Rings</h2></p><p>Who Had The Better Verse: Drake Vs. Future</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Here's one of those songs that will take over the club completely for the next few months, thanks to a chorus that anyone can sing along to after a listen or two. It's so catchy that it's almost annoying...or maybe it is if you aren't huge on Drake.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">As repetitive as the chorus sounds, the two rappers don't really spit many bars to break it up. Drake addresses the haters before Future brags about his lean intake ("I'm drinkin' lean, they thought I died") and his crew ("I run with kidnappers, I'm talkin' 'bout kidnappers /&nbsp;I'm talkin' 'bout murderin' niggas, I'm talkin' 'bout carjackers"). The Metro Boomin beat seems a little more at home for Future, and for that he gets the W again on "Big Rings."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Winner: Future</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Your Vote:</strong></p><p><h2>Drake & Future - Live From the Gutter</h2></p><p>Who Had The Better Verse: Drake Vs. Future</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">After a couple slower tracks, song #3 gives us a mid-tempo bounce. It's a more Drake-sounding song than the prior two, and he really shows up on it. He'll have you singin' "yeah, yeah" before thinking a little deeper at lines like, "On the Billboards, all we do is pop shit /&nbsp;Soon as that night fall, that's when we lock in," which is a nod both to his mainstream success and the method in which Future and him made this tape.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Future comes correct too, at the beginning, and holds down the verse, no doubt. However, Drizzy flows like he's done it a million times on this one, and he's gettin' the W for that.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Winner: Drake</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Your Vote:</strong></p><p><h2>Drake & Future - Diamonds Dancing</h2></p><p>Who Had The Better Verse: Drake Vs. Future</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">After a few tracks sound exactly like what you'd expect from a Drake/Future collab made in Atlanta, "Diamonds Dancing" breaks the mold. With Metro Boomin collaborating with Frank Dukes and Allen Ritter for a beat that could stand on its own two, both artists showcase their rap/singing combos, and even duet a little on the chorus.&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Let's be honest, neither artist really unleashed a wicked-sick verse on "Diamonds Dancing." There just isn't a whole lot of rap going down on the track, but between the sleezy R&B verses and rhymes that we did get, we're giving this one to Future.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Winner: Future</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Your Vote:</strong></p><p><h2>Drake & Future - Scholarships</h2></p><p>Who Had The Better Verse: Drake Vs. Future</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Drake and Future combined in a way much like Kanye and <a href=# class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color" rel>Jay Z</a> did with&nbsp;<strong>Watch The Throne</strong>: they came together to boast. On "Scholarships," Future hits us with these brags:</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I count this money up, I'm already rich"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I come out the gutter, I really made it"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I got a bitch located in every city"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Spent like seven hundred thousand on both of the Bentleys"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Then Drake hits us with...</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I'm ballin' outta control, keep on receiving the scholarships"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"And I rock Kentucky blue on these hoes /&nbsp;Drafted, I'm gettin' chose by these hoes"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"we ain't change, we ain't change"</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Both MCs do their thing, but once again it feels like a Future track with a Drake feature. Future Hendrix, hold this W.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Winner: Future</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Your Vote:</strong></p><p><h2>Drake & Future - Plastic Bag</h2></p><p>Who Had The Better Verse: Drake Vs. Future</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Plastic Bag" is a little more balanced in terms of collaborative energy. With a lush R&B soundscape, we've heard both Drizzy and Future crush tracks like this time and time again.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">This one is for the strippers, and even though Drake is probably the type of guy to whisper, "you're better than this" in a stripper's ear while he's getting a lap dance, he flows pretty nice on the joint. "I be in the club with the bands like I got the keyboard and the drums with me," he boasts over the Neenyo beat.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Future does his thing too, but this one belongs to Drizzy.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Winner: Drake</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Your Vote:</strong></p><p><h2>Drake & Future - I'm the Plug</h2></p><p>Who Had The Better Verse: Drake Vs. Future</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It took six songs for the Six God to really show up with a hot flow on the tape. Not to knock the other tracks, but the flows just aren't urgent, especially on Drake's side of things. On "I'm the Plug," he comes correct, spitting double-time on the mid-tempo joint to really make you turn your head and listen to what the boy has to say.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Lines like, "Y'all should have seen this shit coming in May /&nbsp;We doing 300 records a day /&nbsp;Who really think they can get in the way?" can completely silence the haters and anyone who may have been #TeamMeek a month ago. Drake won then, and he wins again.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Winner: Drake</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Your Vote:</strong></p><p><h2>Drake & Future - Change Locations</h2></p><p>Who Had The Better Verse: Drake Vs. Future</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">For most of the album, Drake puts his emotions to the side to boast about money, ladies and party habits. On "Change Locations," he switches it up, and gives us the good-guy Drake we're used to, opening up with "two&nbsp;in the morning my mind is on you / four&nbsp;in the morning it still hasn't moved," while Future is busy bragging about "60 naked bitches." Are these two at the same party?</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Both rappers come correct, but when you waste bars on "I like that money is money is piling /&nbsp;I see that money just piling /&nbsp;I see it's piling and piling and piling /&nbsp;And piling and piling and piling," it's going to be hard to take home the win.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Winner: Drake</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Your Vote:</strong></p><p><h2>Drake & Future - Jumpman</h2></p><p>Who Had The Better Verse: Drake Vs. Future</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Jumpman" is a pretty serious title for a rapper who has his own official pairs of J's. The last collaborative track on&nbsp;<strong>What a Time</strong>, the track showcases yet again how Future's style rubbed off on Drake&nbsp;throughout the recording process. Drake caught Future's, let's just call it a cough, and drops the funny quip: "(cough cough cough)&nbsp;I think I need some Robitussin."&nbsp;</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Future comes with his typical flow, mentioning drugs by name and interjecting a little humor along the way ("Chicken wings and fries we don't go on dates"). This was a really tough one to call, but it's going to Future.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Winner: Future</strong></p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg"><strong>Your Vote:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdjboN1f4ywn6hlmJaxbsDHnmSbnaSpsrN51Z6prJ1dmb%2Bit8RmraxllqrBtr7EZqWer6M%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
