The premise is simple: one day of the year, for 12 hours, all criminal acts are legal in the U.S. While this results in an astonishingly low rate of crime year-round, during this dreaded night, people are left to their own devices, with the weaker having to fight for their lives as ill-intentioned individuals take advantage of this opportunity to let loose.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=460 data-current-count=460 data-injectable=true>The nightmarish franchise is always a hit at the box office, having gathered more than half a billion dollars so far. This is an incredible feat in and of itself, but wait, there’s more. Fans of The Purge will be able to enter the dystopian universe once more in the future, as a sixth film has already been set in motion. In 2021, movie star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Frank Grillo announced a comeback to the story and revealed details regarding the next movie’s timetable</a>.</p><p data-characters=603 data-current-count=603 data-injectable=true>Before getting into the sixth Purge, viewers would do well to revisit the franchise and recall all the nitty-gritty details they might’ve forgotten about with time. Surely, there are some, especially taking into consideration that the films’ timeline is not clear-cut. When the first movie was released, the Purge was already established as a common event in-universe; it was only in the fourth installment that viewers finally got to witness how it all began. Thus, watching The Purge in chronological order is the way to go for the best experience, and we’ve got you covered on that.</p><h2 id=h-the-purge-movies-in-chronological-order data-injectable=false>The Purge movies in chronological order</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false></figure><ul data-current-count=627 data-injectable=true><li>The First Purge (2018)</li><li>The Purge (2013)</li><li>The Purge: Anarchy (2014)</li><li>The Purge: Election Year (2016)</li><li>The Forever Purge (2021)</li></ul><p data-characters=84 data-current-count=84 data-injectable=false>Now you can enjoy The Purge movies in order; just remember not to enjoy it too much.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJon6ivXam8bsPArZqhZaSdsm681KuenmWdpMOqsdJmoKdln6expr6O</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
