They target their music to a certain group of people. They get inspiration for their music from one place, and they usually only sing in one language. BTS is different. They came in and changed the way people see boy bands through their versatility. Keep scrolling to see why BTS is the most versatile boy band ever.</p><h2 id=their-billboard-awards-appearance><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>Their Billboard Awards Appearance</span></h2><p>It was no surprise that BTS won the Best Social Artist at the Billboard Awards. They yield incredible power over the music industry, simply because they have a huge fan base. Despite whatever nerves they may have felt, they knew that they were paving the way for k-pop in the mainstream media.

Especially when they were in the United States. Thousands of fans were unable to get tickets because every stadium and venue sold out instantly. This is unheard of in the United States for a k-pop band. The WINGS tour had every venue packed to the max, and they continue to do so in their more recent performances. Seeing BTS perform live is one of the most coveted experiences in the music industry right now.</p><h2 id=mic-drop---featuring-steve-aoki><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Mic Drop - Featuring Steve Aoki</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>BTS has had some great songs in their discography. Their ARMY seems to love every single one that comes out. Recently, they have also scored some amazing collaborations with artists like Zedd and Chainsmokers. However, nothing can compare to their collaboration with Steve Aoki on Mic Drop. This song helped push them into the Top 40 hits. They were the first k-pop band to make it into the Top 40, ever. This song is just another way that they made a great name for themselves and showed how their versatility pays off.</p><h2 id=bts-and-the-amas><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>BTS And The AMAs</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>BTS had their first live televised performance at the AMAs, and they rocked it. The fan chants were cacophonous, and you could not help but cheer along. The boy band and their fans knew that this was a huge moment and that it really showed how BTS is a band of trailblazers in the k-pop industry.

RM, the group leader, is the only one who is completely fluent in English. This means that he had to represent and speak for his fellow band members at all of the interviews and press tours that BTS attended. This pressure could have made him crack, but it didn't. His band members supported him in every way that they could, and it definitely helped them get through the challenges associated with being interviewed.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=# title="#Scammys Trends After BTS Grammy Snub">#Scammys Trends After BTS Grammy Snub</a></span></p><h2 id=the-bts-army><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>The BTS ARMY</span></h2><p>The ARMY is the name given to the fan base for BTS.<a href=#> ARMY spans internationally and has hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of members.</a> They united when their favorite k-pop band was nominated for awards.

They put in work to make BTS content accessible<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> by subbing countless videos and retyping interviews</a>. There is no other band in history to have such devoted fans on this big of a scale.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=dna-music-video><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>DNA Music Video</span></h2><p>DNA is one of BTS's most popular songs, to date.

Not very many. BTS is different. They film behind the scenes content and daily life vlogs to show their fans who they are outside their performances. Fans get to see exclusive content like rehearsals. These videos give the ARMY a sense of intimacy and connection with the band members that other bands just do not have. They also get to see that each member of BTS has interests outside of music, and that they are all talented in their own ways.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=# title="BTS And James Corden Patch Things Up By Blocking LA Crosswalk">BTS And James Corden Patch Things Up By Blocking LA Crosswalk</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGhvZqyZorJurtOsZKmqn6uypXnToZyyZZGnsm7Ax55kpqejqXq3sdGsmK2hnJp6o7vYZpmappRisrex0Wg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
