If you're <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, you likely get used to being flanked by bodyguards anytime you step into public view.</p><p>Following Taylor's recent slew of appearances at various <a href=#>NFL</a> games, where she's just feet from regular ticketholders who don't have bodyguards, many are now wondering how many bodyguards Taylor has with her at any given time. Here's what we know about her security detail and why it has often been described as the best in the business.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: TikTok/@barstoolsports</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">How many bodyguards does Taylor Swift have?</h2><p>Taylor has an entire roster of bodyguards, and those bodyguards vary from day to day. It isn't clear exactly how many people she employs as part of her security team, but clips of her bodyguards have occasionally gone viral in part because of how alert and careful they seem to be.</p><p>Given how many people love Taylor and how visible she's been recently, it makes sense that her security would need to be top-notch.</p><p>One expert suggested that Taylor's security detail may cost upwards of $3 million a year, especially if she's being protected around the clock. That security detail is so expensive not just because it works to keep her safe, but also because she hires great bodyguards who help her to feel like she's having as normal an experience as possible despite her insanely high profile.</p><p style=text-align:start>‚ÄúObviously, anywhere she goes is a security issue,‚Äù Chiefs Chairman Clark Hunt said of Taylor. ‚ÄúIt‚Äôs something that we‚Äôve helped her security team handle when she comes to games in Kansas City and I know the visiting teams that we‚Äôve played this year where she‚Äôs shown up have had to do the same thing. She has a really talented security team. They liaison with our security team, and we make sure we get her into and out of the stadium safely.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a title=@barstoolsports href=#>@barstoolsports</a><p>Taylor Swift has 99 Rated Bodyguards üòß @Jack Mac</p><a title="‚ô¨ original sound - Barstool Sports" href=#>‚ô¨ original sound - Barstool Sports</a></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Multiple people are likely protecting her at games.</h2><p>While it's impossible to say for sure how many bodyguards Taylor employs in total, at football games it seems likely that she has multiple people around her making sure that she doesn't come into harm's way.</p><p>Following the AFC Championship Game, there was a memorable moment where commentator Tony Romo attempted to give Taylor a hug and was intercepted by her security before he was eventually allowed to do so.</p><p>Taylor's security team clearly takes their job seriously and knows that they are responsible for protecting one of the most high-profile people in the world. Even <a href=#>Travis Kelce</a>, Taylor's boyfriend, had a memorable encounter with a member of her team when he put his hand on a bodyguard's back so that he could open the door for her.</p><p>Travis, who is one of the most well-known players in football, has no experience with this level of security. Thankfully, Taylor's team has done a remarkably good job of keeping her safe. Here's hoping that streak continues.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnby4ecyapbJlkqSxurPUmqmdq12ZvKa%2FjK2YsqSfp3q0w8ifq2agkauy</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
