But for one of the company’s original signees, there’s hope that everyone can get on the same page to continue growing the company. During a recent interview with <a href=#>Jim Varsallone</a>, Britt Baker explained her point of view when it comes to navigating the internal drama.</p><p>“It’s really, for me, as being the first female signed, and one of the day ones, the OGs, every big announcement that AEW has, it really shakes me to my core in the best way possible that I’m a part of this, I’m the foundation of this wrestling company that, when we first signed our contracts, we didn’t know really what this was gonna grow into,” Baker said.</p><p>“We’d hoped. We were having the most optimistic thoughts as possible, but nothing was really promised. We really all took a leap of faith because up until then, the only major wrestling company was WWE, and to kind of close the door on that for now and say, ‘Hey, no, I really want to go all in on All Elite Wrestling,’ for a lot of people, you really were. You were like, ‘Okay, gonna cross my fingers and hope for the best.’ Just to see all of this play out in the absolute best way possible, it’s so reassuring. It’s very surreal. I wrestled on the very first All In in front of 10,000 people, and that was the first big show I’d ever been a part of, which was essentially the precursor to All Elite Wrestling.</p><p>“Myself, Kenny [Omega], the Young Bucks, MJF, Jungle Boy, the whole day one group of all of us, just to see the growth to now we’re gonna be wrestling in Wembley Stadium, which I think there’s 70,000 tickets sold. That’s huge, it’s massive. It almost seems like that could have never been possible at one point, and it is. You really have to think, the growth, that’s what I think can really rally everyone together, that, ‘Guys, we worked so hard together to get from one point to where we are now. Let’s keep growing, but we can’t do that if we’re all on different pages. Everyone needs to be working together.’</p><p>“I think that’s with every company,” Baker added. “You need to have people on the same page. Internal competition is good. It creates pressure, and pressure makes diamonds. I think competition within a company is great, but at the same time, everybody needs to be fighting for all the same goals.”</p><p><a href=#>Britt Baker Admits She Was Surprised Over Latest T-Shirt Backlash</a></p><p>If you use any quotes from this article, please credit Jim Varsallone with a h/t to&nbsp;WrestleZone for the transcription.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfZJwampwaWKvs7XTrWSbmZuav261za2cq6aRoXqku8ypnK2hpJ68r3nFop6hrF2bvLN506GcZquRorJus86aow%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
