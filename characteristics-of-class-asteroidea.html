The crown-of-thorns starfish, Acanthaster planci, is particularly well-known because it can cause extreme detrimental effects to coral reefs, particularly during population outbreaks (Moran 1988).<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=what-organisms-are-in-class-asteroidea></span>What organisms are in class asteroidea?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>The <b>class Asteroidea</b> belongs to the phylum Echinodermata. As well as the starfish, the echinoderms include sea urchins, sand dollars, brittle and basket stars, sea cucumbers and crinoids.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-a-starfish-bite-you></span>Can a starfish bite you?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Do <b>starfish bite</b>? No, <b>starfish</b> don’t <b>bite</b>. They have no teeth and are not dangerous to <b>humans</b>. These small sea creatures are not exactly known for their voracious appetite and won’t harm <b>you</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-a-starfish-eliminate-you></span>Can a starfish eliminate you?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A snorkeler or scuba diver who dares handle this most dangerous <b>starfish can</b> suffer from nausea, infection, and painful, swollen extremities that <b>can</b> last for more than a week. Some divers <b>kill</b> these predators by injecting the COTS’ own stomach acid into each of their many arms.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=should-you-touch-starfish></span>Should you touch starfish?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>“Simply put, <b>starfish</b> absorb oxygen from water through channels on their outer body. <b>You should</b> never <b>touch</b> or remove a <b>starfish</b> from the water, as this <b>could</b> lead to them suffocating. “Sunscreen or the oil on our skin <b>can</b> harm sea creatures which is another reason not to <b>touch</b> them.”<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=can-we-eat-starfish></span>Can we eat starfish?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>Yes, you <b>can eat</b> a <b>Starfish</b>, and many times in China’s food markets, you will find them being served on a stick. Not too many people <b>eat</b> them because to some, their taste is not appealing. It has been said that they taste like a Sea Urchin but a bit more bitter and creamier.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=why-are-starfish-important-to-humans></span>Why are starfish important to humans?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>A <b>starfish</b> is a marine invertebrate. So <b>starfish</b> are predators, and they’re probably the most <b>important</b> predator in the shallow ecosystem – so the depths where we would dive or swim. They eat basically anything that they can come across. Their feeding activities control the whole ecosystem.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=how-do-you-prepare-a-starfish-to-eat></span>How do you prepare a starfish to eat?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=do-people-eat-penguins></span>Do people eat penguins?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><b>Penguins</b>, long considered to be inedible by even the most hardiest of sailors, have recently been discovered to taste a lot like veal, if cooked for long enough. Opposition for the new foodstuff has been minor, with only nine <b>people</b> (figures adjusted for accuracy) claiming that the <b>penguin should</b> not be <b>eaten</b>.<h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=are-penguins-good-pets></span>Are Penguins good pets?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2>They are very social animals and you would need (at least 20) more companion <b>penguins</b> as they are pack animals and do best in a colony. You would likely keep them at very cold temperatures and with an excess of fresh water and lots of fishes for the <b>penguin</b> to eat. In short: They make horrible <b>pets</b>.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DAxJyfaKCfrHq1u46cn5qqkZjBpr7IrKuim6NivKd5wqWYrKtdlsC1sdGooJ2dkWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
