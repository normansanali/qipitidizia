There's no shortage of brilliant tracks on the LP, but one of my absolute favorites is "Water Under the Bridge," another collaboration between Adele and "Hello" producer Greg Kurstin. The track has an irresistible groove, but more than that, the <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Adele "Water Under the Bridge" lyrics</a> will resonate with <i>anyone</i> who's ever been stuck in "relationship limbo."</p><p>What's "relationship limbo"? It's a frustrating state of confusion in a relationship. (In my experience, it often occurs when there's poor communication between partners.) Perhaps the parameters of the relationship were never clearly defined, or the parties involved have never sat down to discuss their expectations, wants, and needs. Whatever the cause, relationship limbo can be <i>extremely</i> frustrating.</p><p>In the first verse to "Water Under the Bridge," Adele sorts through the "mixed signals" she's been getting from her lover: "If you're not the one for me / Then how come I can bring you to your knees? / If you're not the one for me / Why do I hate the idea of being free? / And if I'm not the one for you / You've gotta stop holding me the way you do / And if I'm not the one for you / Why have we been through what we have been through?"</p><p>In the chorus, she asks him to end things "gently" (if that's what he really wants) — but reminds him that she still thinks there's love between them: "If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently / Don't pretend that you don't want me / Our love ain't water under the bridge / If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently / Don't pretend that you don't want me / Our love ain't water under the bridge / Whoa, whoa / Say that our love ain't water under the bridge."</p><p>"Water Under the Bridge" represents a critical turning point in many confused relationships: the moment when one person finally works up the courage to ask the other to stop messing around and come clean about his or her <i>true</i> feelings. Honestly, is there anyone out there who <i>can't</i> relate? Oh, Adele. You speak to our souls like no one else.</p><p><i>25</i> is <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>available on iTunes</a> now.</p><p><i>Image: </i><a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D><i>Giphy</i></a></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHxyfpRpaGtlkZmyrbHSZq6arJWnera6w56pZqyYmnqjvsidnp5lnK6%2Fqq%2FSZq6ipJxiv6a%2FzqeYrZ1drLa1tIyapbKnnpp6uLTOrGSbnZWjerTA1JyiZqGeYr%2BmuMCtoKimo522sXnLoqSbpw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
