It is made with a NILLA Wafer cookie or graham cracker crust which is out of this world. The crust is made with crushed NILLA Wafer cookies or crushed graham crackers, melted butter, and a little sugar.</p><p>I love to use crispy vanilla-flavored wafers or graham crackers because they have a touch of sweetness and make such a flavorful crust. It is pressed into a pie pan and then baked for 10 minutes. The rest of the pie is no-bake so it is incredibly easy!</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.modernhoney.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Strawberry-Cream-Cheese-Pie-7.jpg alt="Strawberry Cream Cheese Pie.

It is so easy to whip up in a food processor if you have one. If not, you can place the NILLA Wafer Cookies or graham crackers &nbsp;in a large Ziploc bag and crush them using a rolling pin.&nbsp; I place the cookies, melted butter, and sugar in a food processor and pulse until completely ground up.</li><li><strong>Press the crust into a pie dish and bake for 10 minutes at 350 degrees</strong>. This helps to keep the pie crust together. Let cool to room temperature before adding the filling.</li><li><strong>To make the filling, make sure to use slightly softened cream cheese</strong>. This allows for it to mix well with the sugar and heavy cream.&nbsp; Place the cream cheese and sugar in a mixing bowl and whip using a stand or hand mixer for 1-2 minutes. Scrape the bowl and then add the heavy cream.&nbsp; Whip for at least 4 minutes or until the peaks begin to form.&nbsp; The mixture needs to be thick enough to form a pie filling.</li><li><strong>Let it CHILL. This is an important step as the chilling helps to firm up the filling</strong>. Once it has chilled for 1 hour, pour it into the cooled pie crust.&nbsp; Return to the refrigerator.&nbsp; If you want it to be extra firm when cutting the pie, place in the freezer for 1 hour.</li><li><strong>Warm up the&nbsp;strawberry jam in the microwave for about 20 seconds</strong>. Toss the sliced strawberries into the warmed strawberry jam. Place on the top of the filling. Return to the refrigerator until ready to serve.</li><p>I love to hear from you!
