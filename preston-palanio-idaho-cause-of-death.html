My best friend is Preston, and I miss him. We’re looking forward to giving him the biggest and best funeral we can, because Preston wouldn’t want it any other way. So, Jason said, please come join us.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Condolences</h3><p>“This is an extremely hard post to make! Preston Wayne Palanio you are going to be missed I loved you more than you’ll ever know you had so much personality! I can’t believe you are gone but I’m blessed to have you in my life you’re forever in my heart!&nbsp;&nbsp;Rest easy my sweet boy!”</p><p>“Preston was a couple of years older than Ryker but they crossed paths several times over the years. Ryker chased Preston around the ice those 1st couple of years, as Preston was a gifted little hockey player & skated his heart out.</p><p>Our thoughts & prayers are with the Palacio family. Preston had a contagious smile & he will be missed by all! #sticksoutforpreston here at a spring hockey tournament in Vancouver, BC.”</p><p><strong>Read more :</strong></p><ul><li><a href=#>The Truth Behind Jimi Hendrix’s Death, How Did Jimi Hendrix Die?</a></li><li><a href=#>Youtuber Savannah Labrant Reports The 29-year-old Death Of Her Daughter’s Father</a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqwtr7RnqWtZZ%2Bjuaq6xGeaqKVfnrmtusSsqmaZnpl6qbHApauhZ6CnsrTAzqdkqZmclruqu4yim5qgn2KwosHSnmSonl2ZsqLAx2hqaW5obnw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
