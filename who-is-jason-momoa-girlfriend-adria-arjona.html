I’ve been in a relationship for a while,” he told the crowd. “I’m really enjoying [my] privacy ’cause back in the day nobody gave a fuck, and now everybody does.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Less than two weeks after making this statement, the Aquaman star <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/C7McH3FrnRf/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="hard-launched his relationship" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">hard-launched his relationship</a> with an Instagram post, in which he and Arjona were pictured getting quite cuddly during a trip to Japan.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">So who is Arjona and how did she and Momoa start dating? Here’s everything we know.</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">She is a film and TV actor.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Like Momoa, Arjona is a prominent film and television actor. Her first-ever role was in a short film titled Loss, and her first major part was when she landed the recurring role of Dani Silva for a couple of episodes of the CBS sci-fi drama Person of Interest.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Since then, Arjona’s parts have only gotten bigger. She’s been a lead in films such as Hit Man, Pacific Rim: Uprising, 6 Underground, The Absence of Eden, and the 2022 remake of Father of the Bride. She has also had major roles in the TV series Emerald City, Good Omens, and Andor.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One of her latest projects, Blink Twice, was directed by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a40979263/zoe-kravitz-channing-tatum-relationship-timeline/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Zoë Kravitz" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Zoë Kravitz</a>, who was technically Momoa’s stepdaughter during his marriage to Bonet.</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Her father is a famous singer-songwriter.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">It’s clear that performing was always in Arjona’s blood. For proof, just look to her dad, Edgar Ricardo Arjona Morales (known as Ricardo Arjona), a Guatemalan-Mexican singer-songwriter who is one of the most successful Latin American recording artists of all time.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">According to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/ricardo-arjona-mn0000889126 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=AllMusic class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">AllMusic</a>, Ricardo has sold over 80 million records worldwide, and has won a Grammy Award, a Latin Grammy, and five Billboard Latin Music Awards.</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">She has also been married before.</h2><img alt="the 92nd academy awards vanity fair party los angeles" title="The 92nd Academy Awards - Vanity Fair Party - Los Angeles" width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/edgardo-canales-and-adria-arjona-attending-the-vanity-fair-news-photo-1716302977.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v2">Ian West - PA Images</span><span class="css-bf2l0q e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-5rd5i8 e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is not Arjona’s first major relationship. She married lawyer Edgardo Canales in 2019; they separated in 2023. Although the two kept their relationship private, they did attend the Vanity Fair Oscars after-party together in 2020, where Arjona wore a key-lime asymmetrical dress with black stripes. Canales wore a classic black tuxedo.</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">She and Jason have starred in a movie together.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=22 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Although their relationship may be new, Momoa and Arjona have some history. The two first worked together in 2019, on the Netflix thriller Sweet Girl, released in 2021. In the movie, Momoa plays a father who, along with his daughter, seeks revenge against a pharmaceutical company after his wife dies from cancer when a life-saving drug is pulled from the market. Fittingly, Arjona played Momoa’s wife in the film. As it was their first project together, it seems likely that is where the two first met.</p><h2 data-node-id=23 class="body-h2 css-1ooignj emevuu60">Jason hard-launched their relationship on Instagram in May 2024.</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Mere weeks after <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://x.com/MattRooksTaylor/status/1789338212206366804 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=teasing class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">teasing</a> that he was in a new relationship, Momoa <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/p/C7McH3FrnRf/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=hard-launched class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">hard-launched</a> his romance with Arjona on Instagram, when he documented a trip to Japan and sneaked in a few photos with his new partner.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“Japan, you are a dream come true you blew my mind,” the Dune star wrote in the caption. “We’re so thankful for everyone who opened their homes, making memories with new friends and old friends, sharing another amazing adventure with mi amor. ON THE ROAM motorcycles and mayhem. All my aloha j.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=27 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Turns out his “amor” is Arjona, who was seen snuggling up with the actor at dinner in one photo, while another saw the pair laughing as a coastal breeze blew their hair in front of their faces. Finally, Momoa included a pic of Arjona looking effortlessly chic in an olive-green trench as she stood inside a motorcycle shop.</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/04e4fe03-f532-4e6a-8cd4-455131aa4449_1702400410.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Joel Calfee" title="Headshot of Joel Calfee" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Joel is the editorial and social media assistant for HarpersBAZAAR.com, where he covers all things celebrity news.
