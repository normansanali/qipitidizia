As Combs told <a href=#>The Boot</a> in October 2019, Durrette — who is a father — wanted "to write a 'dad' kind of song." Even though Combs and Fulcher were not dads themselves, they drew inspiration from childhood memories. "We were talking about the 'monsters under the bed' thing," Combs said.</p><p dir=ltr>"Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone/ 'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know," Combs sings in the first verse, via <a href=#>Genius</a>, as the song captures a conversation between a father and son. As the singer told The Boot, the themes of the single progressed from a son being afraid of the dark into heftier topics. Later in the track, the child loses his father. "It's okay, boy, I ain't scared/ I won't be here, but I'll always be right there," Combs sings, as the father, near the closing of the song.</p><p dir=ltr>Even though the country star had not lost a parent the lyrics made him emotional. "Man it was just a really intense experience getting through that last verse," he said, per <a href=#>Country Now</a>. To drum up the feelings of loss, Combs reflected on his grandfather's death. "I watched my mother lose her dad. It wasn't a sudden thing," he told <a href=#>Outsider</a> in October 2020. "That was the scene I was imagining in my head."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbWlmaIJ3e9ahmK1llKSytHnEr5ynZaSdvLazx2agpmWcmq63tc2gZJuxXaHCrLGMnKammqNiv6aty6WwZqWVlrtw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
