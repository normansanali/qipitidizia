On a trip through life, Loren and Alexei Brovarnik will be featured.&nbsp;After the pair featured on TLC’s 90 Day Fiancé, they gained a lot of followers and viewers. Now they are returning with the second season of their own spin-off program, Loren & Alexei: After the 90 Days.</p><p>According to Loren & Alexei: After the 90 Days’ official summary,</p><p>Prepare to face life with two children under two as Loren and Alexei do so!</p><p>During Loren’s 2013 trip to Israel, the two fell in love and are now happily married. They bonded and got to know one another before tying the marriage in 2015, two years later. Currently, the couple is parents to two boys and one daughter.</p><h2>In September 2022, Loren and Alexei from After The 90 Days had their daughter Ariel Raya.</h2><p>Despite getting married in 2015, the pair put off having children for a while. They have Shahi Josef, their first child, in 2020. Their second son, Asher Noah, was born the following year, and their youngest kid, Ariel Raya, was born this year in September.&nbsp;Alexei and Loren: The pair will be followed as they make their way through life with two young children in After the 90 Days.

He now manages the warehouse for Invicta Watch Group and has a successful social media business.&nbsp;Loren recently discussed being a mother of three children in an interview with USA Magazine. The actor from After the 90 Days said,</p><p>“It’s a mess. Some folks, for example, recall that while I was pregnant, it was quite evenly balanced. Some individuals said, “Oh, it’s really simple.” Comparatively speaking, moving from one to two is tougher than moving from two to three. You already have a number of them. It’s the toughest thing, but it’s so worth it, some people say.”</p><p>Loren and Alexei also have plans to take their family back to Israel in the next season. Loren is shown telling her parents the news in an exclusive sneak look released by People.</p><p>She stated:</p><p>“We’re considering taking a little trip to Israel.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Alexei-Brovarnik-1.jpg alt="Alexei Brovarnik" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Her mother first assumes it’s a family trip.
