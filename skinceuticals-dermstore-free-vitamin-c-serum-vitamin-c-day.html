It doesn’t matter if you were aware or not — any national holiday is worth celebrating in our books, especially when it surrounds one of the most important nutrients. If you don’t know exactly how to participate in the festivities, you need not worry! Dermstore and Skinceuticals are here to help Us all out.</p><p>The online skincare retailer and lauded brand have teamed up to give their shoppers a special treat in honor of the big day! Not only will you get a free deluxe sample of the bestselling Skinceuticals Vitamin C serum with any purchase, if you pick up a full-size product from the brand you’ll score an additional deluxe sample of the Skinceuticals Resveratrol B E serum as well! This offer is only available while supplies last, so don’t wait too long!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SkinCeuticals-C-E-Ferulic-1-fl.-oz..png><p><strong>Pick up a free Skinceuticals CE Ferulic deluxe 4mL sample with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">any Dermstore product purchase</a>, plus get a free Skinceuticals Resveratrol B E</strong> <strong>deluxe 4mL </strong><strong>sample with the purchase of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">any Skinceuticals item</a>!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Both of the products that you have the chance to sample are five-star rated, top-selling Skinceuticals serums. The C E Ferulic serum formula combines ferulic acid and pure vitamin C and E that helps shield your skin from intense environmental damage. It can also brighten your complexion and give your skin a more radiant glow — and that’s all thanks to the high percentage of vitamin C! Over 2,000 Dermstore shoppers truly can’t stop singing the praises of this serum, and we have a feeling that you may be persuaded to pick up the full-size product after giving it a try during your social distancing skincare experiment.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/SkinCeuticals-Resveratrol-B-E-1-fl.-oz..png><p><strong>Pick up a free Skinceuticals CE Ferulic deluxe 4mL sample with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">any Dermstore product purchase</a>, plus get a free Skinceuticals Resveratrol B E</strong> <strong>deluxe 4mL </strong><strong>sample with the purchase of <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">any Skinceuticals item</a>!&nbsp;</strong></p><p>While you would typically use C E Ferulic in the mornings, the Resveratrol B E is a nighttime serum that can help repair your complexion while you sleep. The formula, which contains pure resveratrol, baicalin and pure vitamin E, is meant to neutralize free radicals and help firm your skin, making your complexion look even more youthful. It’s settled: Vitamin C Day is definitely the day you want to shop at Dermstore!
