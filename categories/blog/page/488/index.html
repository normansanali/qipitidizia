In fact, it's designed from the ground-up as a puzzle that a willing adherent spends a lifetime deciphering. But a Kabbalist wouldn't say Kabbalah is "designed" at all. They would just say, "That's the way the things are," and that Kabbalah is a tool for investigating reality. It opens the mind to deeper truths, allows people to glimpse cosmic secrets, etc. <a href=../../../../kabbalah-meaning-behind-tree-of-life.html>Read More...</a></section></article><article class=list-item itemscope itemtype=http://schema.org/Blog><h2 class=headline itemprop=headline><a href=../../../../where-does-larry-storch-live-was-larry-storch-on-gilligans-island.html>Where does Larry Storch live?
