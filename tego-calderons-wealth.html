His success in these fields has significantly boosted his net worth. Calderon is the recipient of a Latin Grammy Award and has been nominated for this award six times. He has also been nominated for a Grammy Award twice. Tego Calderon has been active in the entertainment industry since 1998.</p><p>Reports indicate that his overall net worth is approximately $3.5 million, as of 2016.</p><h3>Tego Calderon Net Worth $3.5 Million</h3><p>Calderón grew up in a modest family. His mother, Pilar Rosario Parrilla, was a teacher, and his father, Esteban Calderon Ilarraza, was a government official. After completing his studies, Tego worked various odd jobs to make ends meet, such as a taxi driver and parking attendant. He claims that these experiences helped shape his musical style. Within three years, Tego became synonymous with his unique reggaeton style, blending rap with tropical salsa, African rhythms, and dance, using acoustic instruments and turntables. He incorporates rhyming slang languages, particularly the slang of the 1960s and the language of neighboring countries of Puerto Rico. His music addresses themes such as racism in Puerto Rico. His music has gained significant popularity in the USA and Canada, while also making some impact in Europe through Spain.</p><p>His first album, “El Abayarde” (2002), was a massive success, followed by a compilation album “El Enemy de los Guasíbiri” (2004). In 2005, he signed a contract between his independent music label, Jiggiri Records, and Atlantic Records, making him the first reggaeton artist to join a major industry. His first album under the new label, “The Underdog (El Subestimado)”, released in 2006, topped the Billboard Latin Rhythm chart and secured the second position on the Billboard Latin charts. His subsequent studio album, “El Abayarde Contraataca” (2007), received lesser success, ranking 6th on the Billboard Latin chart. Despite this, both albums were well-received by critics and earned Calderon Grammy Award nominations, contributing to the growth of his net worth.</p><p>In 2007, he ventured into acting, making his debut in the film “Illegal Tender” (2007). Subsequently, he played a significant role in the action film “Fast & Furious” (2009), for which he also contributed to the soundtrack. In 2015, his studio album titled “El Que Sabe, Sabe” topped the Billboard Latin Rhythm and Latin charts, and won a Latin Grammy Award for Best Urban Music Album. Music has remained the primary source of Tego Calderon’s wealth.</p><p>Regarding his personal life, Tego Calderon married Michelle Peterbauer in 2006, and they have two children: Ebony Nairobi Calderón and Malcolm X Calderón.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmirnp%2BfYrCiuMOeqaimo2LEpq3LrZ9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
