Likewise, he was signed to the independent record label Black Ice in 2004. He completed his debut studio album, ‘Young & Free,’ in 2006. ‘Black Ice’ delayed the release of the album, opting instead to release the song “Getcha Hands Up.” He left the label after being dissatisfied with the track, its video, and his overall treatment.</p><p>Miguel has since remarked that this experience taught him to take ownership of his marketing rather than to rely on the label to set him apart from the pack of male R&B performers. He acquired a new recording contract with ‘Jive Records’ in 2007.</p><p>Similarly, his follow-up album, ‘All I Want Is You,’ was delayed for several years due to a lawsuit filed by Black Ice for contract breach.

Regrettably, it was not as successful as he had intended. Although its title tune received some attention, it was enough to secure him a position as a support act on Trey Songz’s and Usher’s tours.</p><p>And respectively, the follow-up singles “Sure Thing” and “Quickie” peaked at No. 1 and No. 3 on the Billboard R&B/Hip-Hop Singles chart.
