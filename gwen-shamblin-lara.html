She worked there for around five years. Later, she joined the state’s health department and worked there for five years.</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Weigh_Down_Workshop></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Weigh_Down_Workshop></span><strong>Weigh Down Workshop</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>As a kid, Lara struggled with her weight. To help the people of the society dealing with similar problems, Gwen started consulting practice in the area of weight loss in 1980. In 1986, she founded the Weigh Down Workshop, a series that directed people to stay away from unwanted behaviors and emotions like anger, depression, overeating, and alcohol indulgence and direct their energies to form a genuine relationship with God. Through her workshops, she inspired people towards faith-based eating. After attending her workshops, her followers claimed that the once-obese lost their excess weight, alcohol addicts stopped their alcohol consumption, and the depressed souls experienced real joy. People even said that after learning morals from the workshops and putting them into practice, their finances were restored, and their marriage problems got healed. When the local churches heard of Gwen’s teachings and their surprising results, they started asking Lara to host Weigh Down Workshop classes on their premises.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Gwen-Shamblin-Lara-during-one-of-her-diet-program-workshops.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-70945 class=wp-caption-text>Gwen Shamblin Lara during one of her diet program workshops</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Founding_Remnant_Fellowship_Church></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Founding_Remnant_Fellowship_Church></span><strong>Founding Remnant Fellowship Church</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Gwen founded the Remnant Fellowship Church in 1999 to ensure that God’s people are taken care of. Initially, a small number of people banded together at the back of the Weigh Down building in Franklin, TN, in the shipping department. They gathered daily and devoted themselves to the teaching of the word God and prayer. In 2002, Shamblin bought 40 acres of land in Brentwood, Tennessee, where a church building was constructed. The church building was completed in 2004. Slowly, the membership started growing, with people becoming its members from across the globe. Its membership has now grown to over 150 churches in the U.S.A., Canada, Europe, Africa, and Australia.</p><img data-expand=600 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/getbiography.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Gwen-Shamblin-Lara-during-the-construction-of-the-Remnant-Fellowship-Church.jpg http viewbox style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-70970 class=wp-caption-text>Gwen Shamblin Lara during the construction of the Remnant Fellowship Church</p><h3><span class=ez-toc-section id=Author></span><span class=ez-toc-section id=Author></span><strong>Author</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Gwen Shamblin Lara turned author in 1997 with the book “The Weigh Down Diet.” In the book, she advised using spirituality to avoid overeating.

Later, Gwen wrote a letter to her followers to clarify her statement. She wrote,<br><p>The reason all of this is important is that if you do not understand that God is the clear authority and that Jesus was under God’s authority, then you will not have a clear picture of what it means to be Christ like. Jesus suffered, obeyed, submitted, denied his will, and made it his food to do the will of the Father.”</p><p>She further wrote,</p><p>I believe that Jesus and God are two separate beings.
