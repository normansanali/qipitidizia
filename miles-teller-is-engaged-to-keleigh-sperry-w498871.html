Love both of you guys to pieces and so incredibly happy for this new chapter in your love story! @keleigh_sperry”</p><p>In another snap from York’s slideshow post, the 24-year-old showed off her stunning engagement ring as it sparkled in the sun.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/keleigh-sperry-miles-teller-instagram-zoom-29540b5a-514e-42bd-a48d-bace3d85baef.jpg><p>In a third snap, the model, who has been dating Teller since 2013, looks gorgeous as she holds a single rose and a note that reads: “KS & MT 5/11-13 – 8/20/2017”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/keleigh-sperry-instagram-zoom-7babc634-d79b-40f2-b2f4-2d495e7935c9.jpg><p>In 2015, the <i>Whiplash </i>actor opened about his relationship with the Sperry to<a href=#> <i>E! News</i></a><i></i>, calling her “lovely” and describing their relationship as “pretty easy.” He told the outlet that his love’s “full-time gig is kind of being with me, and before her, I would never invite a girl into that world because I didn’t think I could have both.”</p><p>He added, “She’s allowed me to be able to really focus on acting and do what I want to do. She can come to set, visit me and hang out and doesn’t really distract me from it.”</p><p>The hunk revealed the secrets behind his happy relationship to <i><a href=#>Elle </a></i>in 2014, saying: “Respect the person you’re with. My philosophy is, if I’m not happier when I’m with you, then there’s no reason for me to be with you. I’m happy on my own.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>And while the Pennsylvania native’s demanding acting schedule sometimes means physical distance between the two, the adorable couple always find ways to stay connected.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“We’ll FaceTime and she’ll come down and visit me on set,” Teller told Elle. “There’s times that a text is appropriate. Other times you need to talk on the phone. The problem with people texting all the time is that if you’re texting somebody everything you’re doing throughout the day, there’s no catch up. It removes the recap. I think that’s important.”&nbsp;</p><p>For the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, <a href=#>subscribe to</a> Us Weekly’s YouTube Page.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamoZyawG7AxKWjnqpdnsBusc2gmKCdlGLBsHnKnqOeoZederS8xKupsmWnaYZ5hJZqZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
