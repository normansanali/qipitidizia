The 'Transformers' star's outfit also cinched in her tiny waist to exaggerate her curves, and the risqué neckline highlighted her tattooed décolletage.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/695525544f17-megan-fox-white-mini-dress.jpg><p id=eeMCYhyTj5v data-wc=59>Her makeup added further drama to her look, with her signature winged eyeliner, fluttery lashes, and glossy pouty lips. Her freshly chopped tresses sat just below her chiseled jawline, and she completed her ensemble with a metallic silver bag, a crimson pedicure, and a red-tipped French manicure with silver accents courtesy of celebrity nail artist Brittney Boyce and CND.</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><p id=egp5WQDkUy data-wc=26>The only thing that appeared to be missing from Megan's knockout look was a <a class=hm-link href=#>new tattoo</a> she claimed she had recently inked on her "entire arm".&nbsp;</p><p id=eyj9RoQTz8o data-wc=38>From photos captured of her on the night, the only tattoos visible were the black symbol on the inside of her wrist, and the quote loosely based on Shakespeare's King Lear on the back of her right shoulder.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/f6f4b8cf2010-megan-fox-plunging-dress.jpg><p id=eDOdBWOIPph data-wc=49>It was only last week that Megan claimed during an appearance on The Drew Barrymore Show that she had inked a new design on her arm.
