Be that as it may, it is still clear that for her, her family matters a lot. According to her, her parents have been her great support. It was also them who realized she had the talents for an artist.</p><p>She was only in the sixth grade when her teacher noticed her talent for storytelling and advised her parents to help her channel her creativity. So, after auditioning for three years without landing a role, Isabel who initially attended school in person was switched to online schooling from the tenth grade so that she could focus more on her acting.</p><p>Following that, Isabel’s parents even got her an agent and always helped her make up her mind when she was indecisive about starting her career in the industry.</p><p>So, her parents have been with her throughout the process. In Isabel’s words, they have been her main driving force as they believed in her and kept encouraging her even when she failed to crack auditions. They taught her to struggle and give the craft her all regardless of the role and outcome.</p><p>Isabel was born to her parents in&nbsp;Santa Monica, California, in the United States.</p><h3><strong>Does Isabel May Have Siblings?</strong></h3><p>Isabel seemed like the only child of her parents.
