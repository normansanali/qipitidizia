Spoiler: She’s not.</p><p>“No! No. I’ve never met him,” the <i>Atomic Blonde </i>actress, 41, said. “I met him for like three seconds, like, passing I was just like, ‘Hi!’ because our kids go to the same school.” (Last month, the pair were photographed together at the Santa Monica pier in California.)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>In fact, Theron hopes to date someone that’s not an actor. “I really hope to meet somebody out of this f—king business,” the Oscar winner, whose dated<b> Stuart Townsend </b>and <b>Sean Penn</b>, added. “It’s hard though, it’s tough.”</p><p>She is dating, though. Last week, she revealed that she went on an “incredible date” with a “really cool dude,” but kept mum on his name. “I went on a date maybe, like, a month ago,” <a href=#>Theron told <b>Howard Stern</b> on July 19.</a> “This guy really impressed me. We went for a 9-mile hike in the middle of the night. It was a full moon. But I was really impressed. It was fun.”</p><p></p><p>Theron is currently promoting her new film, <i>Atomic Blonde</i>. On Sunday, a caller asked why it was important that her character, Lorraine Broughton, was bisexual.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Why not? I mean, it’s just so strange when we talk so much about it. It should be normalized by now. It’s something that I feel is not represented enough in cinema, and I feel like when you make movies, if you’re going to hold that mirror up and reflect society, then you should reflect society,” Theron replied.</p><p>That led to Cohen asking if she’s ever swam in the lady pond. “When I was young, yes!” she said. “I feel like when you’re young, you’re just kind of exploring it all, but it was pretty clear that I really like dudes.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacoJGnuarGxGaroZ2ipLturcOdqZ6ro5rAbrPAm6minZxirrau0bJknZmknruoedGupKiqo2LEosDCoWSwbGlog3p%2Bjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
