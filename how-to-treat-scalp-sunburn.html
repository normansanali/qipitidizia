"The scalp is typically over-exposed to the sun as it has little or no protection which results in an uncomfortable and painful sunburn," says Chuck Hezekiah, an educator and brand ambassador at René Furterer. People who are either bald or have thinning hair are especially prone to scalp sunburns, adds <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Dr. Rachel Maiman</a>, a board-certified dermatologist at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Marmur Medical</a> in NYC. The worst part is that this type of sun damage has the potential to be much more than just a temporary discomfort. To learn more about how sunburned scalps can affect our skin and hair, we tapped three skin and hair experts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on to discover how to care for a sunburned scalp.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-does-a-sunburn-affect-the-scalp></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How Does a Sunburn Affect The Scalp?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A sunburned scalp presents similar side effects as it does to the rest of the body. You can expect discomfort, a bit of pain, inflammation, and if it's severe enough, some skin shedding after about a week or so. As such, the after-sun care is similar — we'll get to that in a moment.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Your Scalp Ages Faster Than the Skin on Your Face, So What Does That Mean for Your Hair?</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-whats-the-best-way-to-prevent-a-sunburned-scalp></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What's the Best Way to Prevent a Sunburned Scalp?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hezekiah says the best way is to keep the scalp covered, whether that be by using a UV-protective hat or scarf or using sunscreen, as you would on the rest of your body.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Using regular sunscreen is easier for those with bald heads, but sunscreen mists and powders are a solid option for those with more hair. Options we like are the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Sunbum Scalp & Hair Mist SPF 30</a>, which won't weigh your hair down or make it look greasy, and the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Supergoop!

He recommends using the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>René Furterer Astera Fresh Soothing Concentrate</a> pre-shampoo treatment, as it's made with peppermint, eucalyptus, and Asteraceae (echinacea) extract, which he says will soothe irritated scalps.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Apply Soothing Formulas</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Additionally, Fabian Lliguin, a New York-based hairstylist and co-founder of Rahua, suggests the same when it comes to styling products as well. He explains that many hair styling products use a combination of chemicals and alcohol to adhere to the hair, dry down quickly, and maintain a style's shape. However, when that cocktail warms up on an already irritated scalp, it can further exacerbate existing damage. As such, he recommends using styling products with soothing ingredients, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Rahua's Aloe Vera Hair Gel</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Apply a Cold Compress</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Maiman says that doing cool compresses a few times per day can help relieve the pain of the burn. To further manage the pain, she typically recommends two things. "The first is an over-the-counter strength hydrocortisone 0.1% cream, which can be applied twice daily in the first few days after a burn to suppress inflammation. I also really like aloe vera," she says. "The combination of hydration and anti-inflammatory properties makes it excellent in treating a sunburn."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-faqs-bc350404-8da0-49b8-af4e-63c18e2e501e></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=50><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can a sunburned scalp affect hair?</span></p><p>If there is an impact, it'll only be temporary. "While there may be shedding of the skin that occurs, it's typically not enough to notice but it does impact the skin's microbiome which affects the hair," says Hezekiah. Dr. Maiman further explains that as sunburns are limited to the epidermis, they're not capable of affecting the hair in a detrimental fashion since the hair bulbs are located deep in the fatty layer.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Is it OK to take a hot shower with a sunburned scalp?</span></p><p>It would be better to take a cool shower since a hot shower can lead to further irritation. Running cool water over the scalp can help to soothe it and even reduce inflammation.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=3 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What hairstyles are best for a sunburned scalp?</span></p><p>Loose styles, such as wearing your hair down or in a messy bun or ponytail are gentle on the scalp. Avoid tight styles which can tug and pull at the scalp, which may only serve to irritate it more.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWww4ytpmasopqutXnSnJilqF2owq%2Bu1Kul</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
