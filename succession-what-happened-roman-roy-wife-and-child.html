The fan favourite slime puppy has some serious mommy and daddy issues, an unhealthy relationship with an older woman (that somehow the internet ships), and certainly doesn't seem to be in the right mindset for a wife and child. So why did <a class=hm-link href=#>he appear to have both in season one?</a></p><p id=e8LYFW_pGph data-wc=47>Despite Roman's character developing over several seasons as an emotionally complex individual who struggles to hold down a healthy relationship, the pilot episode of the show sees the youngest Roy sibling joined by what appeared to be his wife Grace and daughter Isla at Logan's birthday party.</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: What happened to Grace and Isla on Succession?</figure><p id=ep7uGsDMHf6 data-wc=68>In the episode, Roman and Grace are both wearing wedding rings, and the actress who plays his wife, Molly Griggs, is credited as Grace Roy on IMDB – appearing to confirm that at one point, Roman was intended to be a married man. However, Grace's daughter Isla is slightly more ambiguous, as Kendall refers to her as his children's 'friend' instead of their 'cousin' in the same scene.</p><p id=ea90_Zx-bud data-wc=30>In the show, the pair eventually break up, and no mention is made of either Grace or Isla again, with Roman eventually striking up failed relationships with Tabitha and Gerri.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a92ad2c42d84-0108successions01.jpg><p id=enCX5TgIH5 data-wc=13><strong>MORE:</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Succession's Brian Cox breaks silence on Logan Roy's shocking episode three twist</a></p><p id=eqP6PWKb9E data-wc=10><strong>MORE: <a class=hm-link href=#>Meet the real-life families of the cast of Succession</a></strong></p><p id=eSV0afkrVyO data-wc=93>This isn't the first time that the writers changed a character from the pilot episode, as Brian Cox also revealed that Logan wasn't originally from Scotland. He explained: "I suggested that Logan Roy could be Scots and Jesse [Armstrong, creator] said, 'Oh no no, he needs to be American, he can't be Scottish.' [Executive producer] Adam McKay on the other hand thought it was a great idea, but Jesse said, 'No no, he's got to be American'. So they decided in the pilot that I was born in Quebec, which isn't really America."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/b342430f668c-0202successions01.jpg><p id=emKOQRorU2Ya data-wc=61>He later added: "Peter Friedman, who plays Frank, said to me, 'I've just done an ADR session: they've changed your birthplace, you're not from Quebec anymore. I said, 'So where am I born?' He said, 'I can't remember...', and he goes and gets his device out and he goes, 'Oh yeah, somewhere called Dundee, Scotland' […] that's [expletive] writers for you."</p><p id=eGErVi6p-_O data-wc=26><strong>Don't want to miss a story?<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Sign up to our What to Watch newsletter</a> and get the heads-up on the shows and films everyone’s talking about.</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5tb3JwYW18tMHCnJysq5mku27Dx5qrZqCRpb2musSdZKunnZa7br7OsmSwoZaaeqK6w2aaoaGcmXw%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
