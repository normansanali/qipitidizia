But I don’t think this is gonna work. I don’t think anything’s gonna work today,” Rob told his Instagram followers on January 29. “So, from my own little reunion show, love you guys, miss you. Hope everyone’s doing great.”</p><p>While fans didn’t get to catch up with the deckhand during the reunion, he answered some fan questions during a recent Reddit Ask Me Anything earlier this month. When asked if he’s still in touch with his costars, Rob replied, “almost all of them,” noting the cast ended up on a “weird ride of having the internet play a game of – jumping to conclusions – about them.”</p><p>During season 8 of Below Deck, fans <a href=#>watched Shane and Elizabeth both get fired.</a> Their early exits were discussed during Monday’s reunion.</p><p>“I gave it my all, I really did. I gave it 100 percent of my effort every time I was on the boat,” Shane said on the reunion after his work ethic was questioned. “I came in very underprepared. I didn’t realize the yachting career entailed as much hard work as it did. I learned that once I stepped foot on the boat.”</p><p>Elizabeth, meanwhile, was fired by Captain Lee amid her tension with Chief Stewardess Francesca.</p><p>“Francesca’s words were not necessarily mean. I just feel that there were tones and there was condescendence,” Elizabeth said on the reunion.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Francesca shot back, “I did on a couple of occasions say, ‘great job’ or ‘well done’ or whatever, but you just, unfortunately, had more mishaps than ‘well dones.’ If you’re not performing you’re best, then [you] can’t cut it.”</p><p>Scroll through for more revelations from the reunion:</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS9qq%2FTrqmeq1%2BXsq271mabnpubYsCmrdKopWZwXaeytrrIqKVmqpWrsq2t06Kmp6tdmsOmvtitn6Kml2LEpnnLnpirppWZfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
