In 2019, she reportedly participated in the Miss Washington USA 2019 contest but couldn’t make it to the final round. As per her profile from Miss Washington USA, she has worked as an Operational Manager, Model, and a TV host/reporter.&nbsp;</p><p>Taylor started seeing Wheeler in mid-2020, and on the hours leading up to the January 23 attack, Wheeler texted her that he had shaved his head. As per Taylor, Wheeler cutting his long hair worried her as he loved his long curls. When she came home, she found Wheeler trying to stay normal and calm, but as time went on, he “started going downhill emotionally”. Taylor stated that Wheeler quickly entered into a dark place and reportedly asked Taylor to “bow down.”</p><p>“And I asked him why. And he didn’t respond. He just told me to bow down again. And I told him no. And he immediately grabbed my neck. And that’s when things began,” Taylor recalled.</p><p>Wheeler, who previously played two seasons with the New York Giants, did not react to Taylor’s injuries. When she had touched her face, she found that she was bleeding. She quickly ran towards the bathroom to check and call 911, while Wheeler reportedly stood by the doorway saying, “Wow, you’re, you’re still alive”.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>“I had touched my face.
