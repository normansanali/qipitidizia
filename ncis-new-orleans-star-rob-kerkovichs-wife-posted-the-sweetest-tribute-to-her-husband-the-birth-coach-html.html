His wife, Anjali Prasertong, however, knows him as a supportive husband and father. In her latest Instagram post, Prasertong credits Kerkovich for helping her feel “brave” and “unstoppable.”</p><h2>Rob Kerkovich and Anjali Prasertong have a love story for the ages</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Rob-Kerkovich.jpg><p id=par-2_37>Sebastian Lund may not have much of a romance story-line on NCIS: New Orleans, but in real life, Rob Kerkovich has. The star and his wife, registered dietician, Anjali Prasertong, have been happily wed since 2011.</p><p id=par-3_48>Kerkovich often posts about his mate on Instagram, gushing over their relationship through the years. In&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>a 2018 post</a>, he said, “Seven years of this beautiful person standing by my side, holding me up, talking me off the ledge, and watching reality shows about monster makeup. Love you, Muffinhead.”</p><p id=par-4_34>It’s unclear how long the two have been together, but it’s long enough Prasertong believed in Kerkovich’s dreams enough to make the move from Los Angeles to The Big Easy for <a href=#>NCIS: New Orleans</a>.</p><p id=par-5_11>Together, the two support various causes but support each other more.</p><p id=par-6_12>In <a href=#>another post from June 2019</a>, Kerkovich boasted about his wife’s accomplishments.</p><p id=par-7_32>“She did it. She’s done. After four schools, a wedding, a childbirth, a move across the country, and countless other hurdles,&nbsp;@anjaliruth&nbsp;is finally an R.D. A beautiful, intelligent, stylin’, anchor-of-the-household R.D.&nbsp;#bonafide” he said.</p><p id=par-8_20>The two are the proud parents of one child, and on Feb. 11, they welcomed their second — another boy.</p><h2>Prasertong praised Kerkovich for this reason</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-2></figure><p id=par-9_50>In an <a href=#>earlier post on Oct. 2019</a>, Prasertong — dressed up for Halloween — revealed her second pregnancy saying she was due in Feb. with another boy. Though the “Kertongs’ lead a private life, Prasertong took to Instagram to showcase the kind of man Kerkovich is outside of the cameras.</p><p id=par-10_54>“If you ever have to do the strange, difficult, messy, life-changing, beautiful and singular work of giving birth, I hope you have a birth coach like&nbsp;@robkerkovich, one who makes you feel brave and unstoppable even when all seems impossible and dark,” she captioned the photo. “I’m so excited to raise another kid with him.”</p><p id=par-11_28>You’d have never known Prasertong was in labor at the time. <a href=#>Kerkovich’s only Tweet</a> that day referenced his favorite moment from the NCIS: New Orleans midseason premiere.</p><p id=par-12_23>Keeping their love and family life separate from the public eye only makes devoted NCIS fans that much more of a “Sebastian” fan.</p><h2>It’s a tie as to who posts the sweetest tributes to the other</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed-instagram wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram" id=emb-3></figure><p id=par-13_26>While Kerkovich does a bang-up job thanking Prasertong every now and then, we’d be remiss not to mention Prasertong’s other tributes to the mysterious Massachusetts native.</p><p id=par-14_47>In an <a href=#>Aug. 2018 throwback photo</a> posted by Prasertong, she said, “Happy birthday to&nbsp;@robkerkovich, pictured here in 2008 in our first apartment together, holding our first baby. It’s been a decade, but I still have just as big a crush on him as I did back then.”</p><p id=par-15_28>The year before, she wished Kerkovich a happy birthday saying, “A very happy birthday to&nbsp;<a href=#>@robkerkovich</a>, partner in crime, champion dad, and undisputed King of the Turtleneck since 2012.”</p><p id=par-16_68>And, in a <a href=#>touching Father’s Day post</a>, circa June 2017, Prasertong said this of the NCIS: New Orleans star: “Happy Father’s Day to the dad who knows the name of every dinosaur, who has the coolest taste in books, and who is tall enough to reach the top of any tree*. You are the best**. *According to your very lucky son. **According to everyone who knows you.”</p><p id=par-17_18>Could these two be any cuter? Congratulations to the “Kertongs” on the new addition. Now, it’s Sebastian’s turn.</p><p id=par-18_10>NCIS: New Orleans airs Sundays at 10 p.m. on CBS.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7pLXSZqWer12kv62xwKeqZquklr9uvs6bZKSdoqC8t7XCoapmr5mbsm68zqyrnpxdqbWmedKwnJ6slajBbsDRopmurJViwbB5x56pZqClqK%2BiusNmq6GdXZe2s8DHZpqomZOde6nAzKVm</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
