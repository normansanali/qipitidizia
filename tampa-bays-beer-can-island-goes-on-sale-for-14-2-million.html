(<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>WFLA</a>) – A party spot for generations of Tampa Bay area residents is on the market for just over $14 million.</p><p>Pine Key, more commonly known as “Beer Can Island,” is a 9-acre island that sits in Hillsborough Bay between MacDill Air Force Base and Apollo Beach.</p><p>Boaters had anchored at the tiny island for decades before it was purchased by a group of friends six years ago and transformed into a members-only party spot. They set up bathrooms, thatched roof structures, a bar and an inflatable slide for the paid members.</p><a href=# class=promo-link__link>How much water – or Stanley cup refills – should you really be drinking each day?</a><p>Their use of the unzoned property <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=# data-type=URL data-id=https://www.wfla.com/news/hillsborough-county/hillsborough-planning-commission-working-to-determine-future-of-pine-key-aka-beer-can-island/>drew criticism from local officials</a>, who ordered the owners to shut down the bar. They also voiced concerns about the Hillsborough County Sheriff’s Office’s ability to respond to emergencies at the island.</p><p>The island’s owners and local officials had not reached any agreement concerning zoning, according to the <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Tampa Bay Times.</a></p><p>Now, the owners are looking to sell the property, perhaps to “corporations and international investors seeking a unique retreat,” according to a press release.</p><p>“With the right vision and willingness to collaborate with Hillsborough County, opportunities for development could be explored and expanded upon,” the island’s owners stated.</p><p>The release did not go into why the group was selling the property, which they purchased in 2017 for around $65,000. (The Tampa Bay Times, however, noted that one of the owners once acknowledged that the island was eroding, and had predicted in 2021 that it could be just <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>a “sand bar”</a> within the next several years.)</p><p>“This opportunity is exceedingly rare, as Pine Key is one of the only privately owned islands in Tampa Bay,” Cole Weaver, majority owner of Pine Key, said in a statement. “We’re grateful for the outpouring of support we have received from the community and our members over the years, but all good things must come to an end at some point, and for us, that time is now.”&nbsp;</p><a href=# class=promo-link__link>WWII-era Great Lakes ship that claimed captain’s life found</a><p>Over 60 acres of submerged land surrounding the island is also included in the $14.2 million deal. The owners described the property as a “unique opportunity for innovation,” as it is one of the few privately-owned islands in the Tampa Bay area.</p><p>“While historically recognized for hosting events, Pine Key is equally positioned as an exclusive VIP property, providing a perfect setting for either private sole or corporate ownership,” the news release stated.</p><p>Beer Can Island is now officially closed to members — and to the public — as it waits to be sold.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sMHRqqyanJOewaqx0meaqKVfo7K4v46nmK2hn6OurXnNnq6sZ6SWurGtjJuYsqtdl7KmvoycmKdlmai5orrDZp6onaNivK950pqjnmWWpL9ufZNmaWalmaG5qrvNaA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
