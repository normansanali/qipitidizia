That is how he rose to fame, and it is how he built his brand. In his early videos, fans saw MrBeast shoot videos pranking his friends and family. In one video, he destroyed his friend’s car and then surprised him with a new one. However, things turned out differently when it was him on the receiving end of the prank!</p><p>In a recent video that went viral on social media, the American YouTuber got arrested. However, in what turned out to be a prank, the YouTube giant kept his cool and tackled the entire situation with shocking calm.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>MrBeast maintains composure during fake arrest</h2><p>Airrack pulled a prank on Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson. While MrBeast was driving around in his native state of North Carolina, his Tesla was pulled over for having a dark window tint. Subsequently, when the police looked his ID up in their system, and mentioned there was a warrant out for his arrest! Following this, he was taken to a holding cell, kept without food and water, and finally given one phone call that revealed the entire prank.</p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Screenshot-2023-05-25-at-12.33.15-PM.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>Throughout this entire ordeal, Donaldson maintained his composure. A lawyer, YouTuber Law By Mike, analyzed what MrBeast did, praising MrBeast for keeping his cool. The lawyer explained the way Jimmy behaved was indicative that he had a sense this was a prank.</p><p>Firstly, the lawyer elaborated that while window tints are illegal in North Carolina, people do not see police pulling individuals over for them in most cases. The warrant for his arrest was for a “communication threats” charge. The charge is only brought if the threat is serious and violent. Even if MrBeast had committed this misdemeanor, he would have first received a court date. Only if he had not appeared in court, the warrant would have been issued.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-esports-nfl-news-mrbeast-tom-brady-beast-vs-brady-comparing-the-networth-of-two-of-the-most-influential-men-in-history-mrbeast-and-tom-brady?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Tom-Brady-MrBeast-1-560x315.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Beast Vs Brady: Comparing The Networth Of Two Of The Most Influential&nbsp;Men&nbsp;in&nbsp;History</p></a><p>Despite Donaldson having a feeling it was a prank, he excised caution throughout the entire event. As the police asked him questions, MrBeast stayed silent, not responding to anything. The lawyer says, “He does one incredibly smart thing when the police were asking him questions. He shuts up. He didn’t invoke the 5th [5th Amendment] properly. If Jimmy was a subscriber, He would know that you can’t just stay silent, you have to say that you are remaining silent or invoke the 5th. That way, they can’t use your silence against you later.”</p><p>In the end, when MrBeast finally got his phone call, it turned out to be Airrack. He revealed there were no charges, and these were off-duty police taking part in the prank. Regardless, Donaldon’s behavior and calm show he knew he did nothing wrong. He handled the matter with grace.</p><p>What are your thoughts on MrBeast’s arrest? Did the prank go too far?
