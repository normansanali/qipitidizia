He is a native of Johnston, Rhode Island, United States of America. He grew up alongside his two elder brothers.</p><p>When Mat was four years old, he saw magic on television and requested his parents to buy him a magic set. He subsequently began performing feats in his kindergarten class, and his grandmother, Eleanor Campellone, was a major inspiration and his first assistant. When he was too little to read for himself, she used to read magic instructions to him.</p><p>Similarly, one of his fondest childhood memories is of him and his grandmother attempting to figure out how to make cards appear out of thin air, similar to a magician they had seen on television. They hung a black curtain in the living room and cut a hole in it. His grandmother concealed herself on the opposite side and delivered cards to Mat through the curtain. His grandfather sat and watched Mat play with the excuse that “grandma must have stepped outside for a minute,” and he had no idea how the cards appeared.</p><p>As a child, he continued to study magic and performed whenever the opportunity presented itself. Mat had collected enough money from local events when he was 12 years old to fly to Las Vegas and study performance art with some of his idols, including Jeff McBride.</p><p>Mat Franco graduated from Johnston High School in 2006 and served as the wrestling team’s captain during his senior year. Then he attended the University of Rhode Island, earning a bachelor’s degree in business administration with a concentration in communication studies.</p><h2>Height and Weight</h2><p>Mat Franco is roughly 5 feet 11 inches tall and weighs approximately 75 kilograms. However, additional details such as his chest, waist, hips, biceps, shoe size, and dress size remain unavailable. Mat, likewise, has brown eyes and brown hair.</p><h2>Career</h2><p>Mat Franco is an award-winning magician from NBC’s America’s Got Talent. He approaches magic in a novel way that is motivated by pure joy. He is largely self-taught. Mat then began producing his own shows before the age of ten. Similarly, he developed a performing approach emphasizing his inherent warmth and wit.</p><p>After winning America’s Got Talent and starring in his first primetime television special, Mat Franco’s Got Magic, he is now headlining his own show, MAGIC REINVENTED NIGHTLY, at Las Vegas’s The LINQ Hotel + Experience. It is an improvisation-fueled stage show that provides endless entertainment and a breathtaking sensation of wonder and awe.</p><p>This show was named “Best Show” by Las Vegas Weekly and twice named “Best Magic Show” by the Las Vegas Review-Best Journals of Las Vegas Awards. MAGIC REINVENTED NIGHTLY continues to get acclaim from both fans and critics. This set the path for the LINQ Theater to be renamed The Mat Franco Theater in the summer of 2017.</p><p>Mat was invited to perform onstage at the Riviera Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in 2003, when he was only 15 years old, as part of a program presented by the Society of American Magicians called “Stars of Tomorrow.” Mat Franco spent the next four years performing for colleges and universities across the country. This aided him in gaining notoriety as a sought-after performer more quickly.</p><p>Mat Franco presented his one-man act on college campuses across the United States after graduating from college in 2010. He toured six months of the year for four years. Mat was nominated for “Fastest Rising Star” in 2012, and subsequently won the Reader’s Choice Award for “Best College Performer” in 2013 by Campus Activities Magazine, based in Prosperity, South Carolina.</p><p>Mat then broadened his reach in early 2014 by auditioning for America’s Got Talent. Noting that his time on America’s Got Talent helped him hone his performing abilities, Mat Franco expresses hope that his victory over 100,000 other hopefuls will have a greater impact on his chosen field.</p><p>Mat Franco auditioned for the show’s 904th episode. He did a card trick in which he presented a story about his magic career and the America’s Got Talent judges while picking the appropriate cards. Additionally, Mat developed the illusion of cards changing into images of the judges. Howard Stern, Heidi Klum, Mel B, and Howie Mandel served as judges on America’s Got Talent this season.</p><p>Mat Franco advanced to Judgement Week after receiving four Yes’s from all four judges during the audition. This week, he was classified as a “Magician.” Mat persuaded Mel B to pick a random card during his performance in Episode 907, and then arranged the cards on a table so that their backs formed an image of Howie Mandel holding the card Mel B chose. His performance was sufficient, and as a result, he advanced to the Quarterfinals in Episode 908.<br>Additionally, Mat Franco’s performance in the Week 2 Quarterfinals was featured in Episode 911. He sprayed a playing card image on the back of a wall with paint and invited Heidi Klum to choose a random card from a deck of cards. Then he unveiled the painted wall, which depicted a card other than the one Heidi chose.</p><p>He displayed Heidi’s card imprinted on the wall after setting the wallpaper on fire. Mat later stated that the card he painted was placed in Howie Mandel’s back pocket. For this performance, Mat Franco received standing ovations from judges Howard Stern, Heidi, and Howie.<br>Mat won in mid-September 2014. He then became the host of America’s Got Talent Live. It took place at Las Vegas’s Planet Hollywood Resort and Casino. Mat has appeared on various television programs, including Today, Live! with Kelly and Michael, and Access Hollywood Live. He instantly began honing brand-new material for his MAGIC REINVENTED NIGHTLY headline act.</p><p>MAGIC REINVENTED NIGHTLY’s full-scale production enables Mat to perform his magic with a greater feeling of a spectacle than ever before. This was accomplished while retaining the effortless intimacy that has long been a hallmark of his performances. Additionally, Mat Franco’s work remains new due to his ongoing boundary-pushing. Additionally, it entails a creative process founded on relatability.</p><p>Similarly, he is a notable philanthropist in the Las Vegas community. As a result, Mat recently increased the scope of his long-standing engagement with The Animal Foundation. Nevada’s largest animal shelter is located here. Mat collaborated with it in 2019 to help promote pet adoptions throughout the hectic summer season. He is featured in the campaign’s print, outdoor, radio, and television advertising.</p><h2>Mat Franco Net Worth</h2><p>As of October 2023, Mat is estimated to have a net worth of $3 million dollars. He earns most of his money through his magic shows, YouTube, and numerous other shows across the country.</p><h2>Mat Franco Wife, Marriage</h2><p>Mat Franco is currently married to Tianna Scartabello, a long-time girlfriend. They exchanged vows on Thursday, August 22, 2019. Their wedding ceremony was held at The Montage Hotel in Laguna Beach, California, and was themed “tropical oasis” with a modest guest list.</p><p>Tianna was the creative force behind the wedding, and she enlisted the assistance of Victoria Trancao of A Good Affairs to prepare their big night. Their first dance together as a married couple was to Can’t Help Falling In Love With You by Elvis Presley. They then spent their honeymoon at Bora Bora.</p><p>According to the couple, they met while both were students at the University of Rhode Island. Mat had butt-dialed Tianna, and the two spent Thanksgiving 2010 conversing all night. Then, in January 2011, they began dating officially.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGikmqxdm7%2BiusKoZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
