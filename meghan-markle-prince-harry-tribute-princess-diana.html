It is wonderful to see her legacy carried forward." <a class=hm-link href=#>Prince Harry</a> often talks about his close relationship with his late mum, and the devastating impact her death had on his life. In an interview with in 2016, the royal spoke about his charity work and his determination to ensure that her legacy is never forgotten. He said: "We will do everything we can to make sure she's never forgotten and carry on all of the special gifts, as such, that she portrayed while she was alive. I hope that my mother's talents are shown in a lot of the work that I do."

Meghan's ring, designed by the Prince, also paid tribute to Meghan's late mother-in-law to be. Two stones from Diana's private jewellery collection were included in the now-iconic ring. "It is days like today when I really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news," Harry said in a BBC interview.
