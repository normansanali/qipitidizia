That’s not throwing shade at the Jennifer’s Body actress, it’s just going off of past precedent. Over two decades in the entertainment industry has seen Fox work on a number of blockbuster movies such as the Transformers franchise and Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, as well as headline major modelling gigs such as the cover of Sports Illustrated.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true>Nevertheless, Fox peeled back another layer of her personality on Aug. 8 when she revealed the cover of her book, Pretty Boys Are Poisonous. The slightly deceiving title may lead one to assume this book is a memoir that chronicles her life orbiting the presence of pretty men such as, say, her fiancé Machine Gun Kelly. In reality, Pretty Boys Are Poisonous is not your average celebrity debut book.</p><h2 id=h-what-is-pretty-boys-are-poisonous-about data-injectable=false>What is Pretty Boys Are Poisonous about?</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Megan Fox (@meganfox)</a></p></figure><p data-characters=282 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>Pretty Boys Are Poisonous is first and foremost, a 192-page book of poetry comprised of more than 70 poems written by Fox. Typically, when a movie star announces they are penning a book, a memoir is the first thought that comes to mind. Of course, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fox is not your typical celebrity</a>.</p><p data-characters=388 data-current-count=388 data-injectable=false>In her synopsis, Fox hinted that PBAP would include never-before-heard stories about men who have existed either in the forefront or perimeter of her life. This means we could get an inside look at her high-profile divorce with ex-husband Brian Austin Green with whom she separated in 2021, her relationship with Machine Gun Kelly, or damning details about various other men in Hollywood.</p><p data-characters=251 data-current-count=639 data-injectable=true>More importantly, PBAP will shed light on secrets she has burdened herself with keeping. Fox described the book as a remedy to the “illness that had taken root in me because of my silence.” Her full synopsis can be found below; it alone is poetic.</p><p>“These poems were written in an attempt to excise the illness that had taken root in me because of my silence. I’ve spent my entire life keeping the secrets of men, my body aches from carrying the weight of their sins. My freedom lives in these pages, and I hope that my words can inspire others to take back their happiness and their identity by using their voice to illuminate what’s been buried, but not forgotten, in the darkness.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=324 data-current-count=324 data-injectable=false>Publisher Simon & Schuster called PBAP “a heartbreaking and dark collection of poetry” told through Fox’s “wicked humor”: “Over the course of more than seventy poems Fox chronicles all the ways in which we fit ourselves into the shape of the ones we love, even if it means losing ourselves in the process.”</p><h2 id=h-when-does-pretty-boys-are-poisonous-hit-the-bookshelves data-injectable=false>When does Pretty Boys Are Poisonous hit the bookshelves?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/Megan-Fox-.jpg><p data-characters=186 data-current-count=186 data-injectable=false>You won’t have to wait long to get your hands on Pretty Boys Are Poisonous.
