He is currently the host of CBS’s Late Show with David Letterman, which has been on air since 1993.The Indiana native got his start as a local TV anchor and weatherman in Indianapolis. In 1975, he moved to Los Angeles where he performed standup comedy and caught the attention of scouts from NBC’s The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson. He quickly became a favorite of Carsonls, which earned him a regular guest spot on the show in 1978. By 1980, NBC granted him The David Letterman Show and, in an attempt to keep him under contract, the network gave him a later timeslot in 1982 with Late Night with David Letterman. Controversy arose in 1993 when Letterman did not succeed Carson in The Tonight Show (the spot was given to<a href=#><strong> Jay Leno</strong></a>). This ultimately caused his switch to CBS, where Letterman has been on air ever since.Letterman has had one of the longest careers on late-night TV – second only to Carson, whom he’s considered his mentor.
