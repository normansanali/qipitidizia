That posterior cannot be tamed, clearly.</p><p>But yesterday, Ariel tweeted out that this isn’t deliberate.</p><p>"I literally do not try and show my ass when I wear shorts…my ass just eats them up and then I don’t notice…awkward af."</p><p>(Note that "af" means "as f–k," basically just meaning "very" in youthful parlance shared by Millennials and those members of Generation Z who are of tweeting age, though Ariel is definitely a Millennial)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2024/02/thg-placeholder.jpg><p>In the past, Ariel has made some stellar points about body positivity, slut-shaming, and very specifically about how showing her butt isn’t a big deal.</p><p>And she’s right, it isn’t.</p><p>Barring some really rare birth defects or truly tragic accidents, everybody has a butt.</p><p>Yes, even the folks who lament that they "have no ass." They have a butt, it’s just not particularly large or shapely.</p><p>Though <a href=#>Ariel Winter’s twerking</a> shows that she knows the effect that her butt can have, she’s defended herself and her shorts-wearing before, saying that she’s <a href=#>not a whore for wearing short-shorts</a>, basically.</p><p>That’s true. The clothing that you wear doesn’t make you promiscuous or a sex worker. And neither being promiscuous or sex workers are a bad thing.</p><p>We would point out that we’d advise everyone, not just Ariel Winter, to be conscious of how much of their bodies their clothing might reveal.</p><p>Show as much as you like, sure, but if you don’t want the parking lot to see your derriere when you put away your groceries, keep that in mind when you pick out your outfit for that day.</p><a href=#><h2 class=block-title>Ariel Winter: The Hottest Pics of an Internet Legend in the Making</h2></a><a class=btn href=#><span>VIEW GALLERY</span></a><ul class="dpsp-networks-btns-wrapper dpsp-networks-btns-share dpsp-networks-btns-content dpsp-column-auto dpsp-has-button-icon-animation" style=padding:0;margin:0;list-style-type:none><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-facebook" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-facebook dpsp-no-label dpsp-first" aria-label="Share on Facebook" title="Share on Facebook" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-twitter" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-twitter dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Share on Twitter" title="Share on Twitter" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-email" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-email dpsp-no-label" aria-label="Send over email" title="Send over email" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li><li class="dpsp-network-list-item dpsp-network-list-item-reddit" style=float:left><a rel="nofollow noopener" href=# class="dpsp-network-btn dpsp-reddit dpsp-no-label dpsp-last" aria-label="Share on Reddit" title="Share on Reddit" style=font-size:14px;padding:0;max-height:40px><span class=dpsp-network-icon><span class=dpsp-network-icon-inner></span></span></a></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoaalpKmsvLCwxqiqrKGgY7CwuY5rZ2pvX2WGcK3RopylZaeeu7Wx0WagZpyfo8FuucSapWasn2LAqbvWZqSyZZKqwbV5wKWjZqyYmnq1tcyeZg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
