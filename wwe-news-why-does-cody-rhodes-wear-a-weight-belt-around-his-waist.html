The moniker of </span><a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9><b>American Nightmare</b></a><span> is something he came up with. This persona of his is very different from his previous iterations at the company as he decided to add his own unique touch to it. From the costume to his style, everything screams how different and much evolved he is from now. But one thing that strikes out is the slightly worn-out weight belt which he wraps around him. Turns out there is a special and heartfelt story behind it.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Cody Rhodes embraces the past and lives in the present</strong></h2><p><span>The fabled belt made its first appearance in WWE at WrestleMania 38, where Rhodes returned to the promotion as Seth Rollins’ surprise opponent for the night. It was stated that he insisted on wearing the belt. In many ways, the belt is a way to nod and pay respects to his past while trying to grow more in the future. In his own words, he once said in a tweet, </span><i><span>“In many respects, I’m alone out there, but also I’m not…carry it with you, all of it”</span></i><span> hinting that the belt holds a deep significance for him.</span></p><p><span>What makes this belt special is the fact that he has written the names of all the promotions and independent circuits he has worked with during his time away from WWE. He carries the custom belt which is a part of his costume, with him showing his appreciation for the promotions from where he learned new skills and grew. The names include IMPACT Wrestling, New Japan Pro Wrestling, ROH, NWA, EVOLVE, Chaotic Wrestling, House of Glory, DEFY Wrestling, Big Time Wrestling, Limitless Wrestling, Blitzkrieg Pro, PWG, and AEW with a special mention of All In.</span></p><p><span>Fans could agree with the fact that the 38-year-old star has evolved a lot as compared to his previous run at the promotion. However, there was one particular breaking point that made him leave WWE.</span></p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9><strong>Why did Cody Rhodes leave WWE in 2016?</strong></h2><p><span>Being a part of a wrestling family comes at a price. Cody Rhodes’s half-elder brother Dustin Rhodes was known for his gimmick <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Golddust</a>. As the promotion decided to make a tag team out of the two brothers, Cody Rhodes briefly took the persona of Stardust, an accomplice of Goldust from outer space. However, o</span><span>n an episode of Dale Jr. Download, he admitted the fact that trying to be Stardust was creatively frustrating and was doing numbers on his mental health.&nbsp;</span></p><img id=img-tag-node--img-loader-0 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/20201226212617/stardust-wwe.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span>On the same podcast, he further revealed why he decided to quit. In 2016, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Charlotte Flair</a> brought a young fan backstage as the fan wanted to see Stardust. Upon seeing Cody Rhodes without his makeup and costume, he questioned, whether he was Stardust. He admitted that this was the moment when had hit rock bottom.</span></p><p><span>The fact that the fan didn’t know anything about Rhodes and only saw him as a gimmick had sent him down a spiral. It was at this moment he decided to quit WWE and find his identity at individual promotions.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>With him now set to face Damian Priest with an <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>injured leg</a>&nbsp;at the Crown Jewel, fans have been in love with the new Cody Rhodes. What lies ahead of this star is something that only time can tell us.&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong>Watch This Story:&nbsp;<a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>5 Deserving WWE Stars Who Never Main Evented WrestleMania</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pr%2FSnqWtoZGhubq%2Fz6ipratemLyue9awnGamlazAbsPHsmSdp5WoeqS7w7Jkq6CfmbK0edaemKtlkWLEprXGoatmmpWhwW6t0aisp5xdnba0edaaoKysXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
