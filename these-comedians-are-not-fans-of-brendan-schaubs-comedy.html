However, running through the cities is precisely what the former fighter and current comedian has been doing while attempting to make with the funny. Schaub has been doing stand-up countrywide and abroad for almost 8 years at this point, and well, It seems he’s beginning to lose not only momentum but also support from the comedy community, for the most part.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Joe Rogan Apologizes To Spotify For Neil Young Backlash</a></span></p><p>An ever-growing list of internet critics that includes a host of YouTubers such as Revenge of the Cis, Beige Frequency, and Yew Neek Entertainment (<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">the latter is currently being sued by Schaub</a>) is one thing; however, The Fighter and the Kid host is now being openly criticized, and in some cases mocked by his peers. Let’s take a look at some of the comedians who are not the biggest fans of Mr. Thiccc Boy.</p><h2 id=the-gringo-papi-may-have-been-the-last-straw><span class=item-num>8 </span><span>The Gringo Papi May Have Been The Last Straw</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The Gringo Papi is Brendan Schaub’s latest comedy special. Released on his brand new Thicc Boy YouTube channel, the special has not been received well, and that’s being kind. It seems that<a href=#> the man known for saying outrageous things</a>’ special has other comedians finally breaking their silence and sharing their opinions about Schaub’s brand of comedy. Seemingly, a combination of suing YouTubers, <a href=#>feuding with respected comedian Bobby Lee and wife Khalyla Kuhn</a>, and releasing a special with jokes such as “Mexican cookie? What are you talking about? What is that? Chocolate chips with salsa all over it? What are you talking about?” has been all the comedy community can take.</p><h2 id=tony-hinchcliffe><span class=item-num>7 </span><span>Tony Hinchcliffe</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Comedy Central’s roast king Tony Hinchcliffe has begun to roast Schaub on his comedy podcast Kill Tony recently. For those who aren't in the know, Kill Tony is a live podcast in which would-be or amateur comedians are randomly chosen and are given one minute to showcase their best material before being judged or roasted by Hinchcliffe and his guest judges. During an episode of Kill Tony, Hinchcliffe openly mocked Brendan Schaub, comparing one of the amateurs on stage to the former UFC heavyweight.</p><h2 id=joey-diaz-at-first><span class=item-num>6 </span><span>Joey Diaz (At First)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Joey “Coco” Diaz is a boisterous, charismatic comedian/actor who has graced both stage and screen for well over 20 years. Diaz (a good friend of Joe Rogan's) made his feelings about Schaub entering comedy clear to Schaub himself in the early stages of his career, but expressed a change of heart. However, during an episode of his podcast, Diaz expressed his opinion after viewing The Gringo Papi, politely stating, “I watched 15 minutes of it… It’s Brendan. Is it f**king hysterical? No.” He did praise both Schaub’s work ethic and state that there were funny moments within the special.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Joe Rogan Refuses To Appear On This Show Despite Fans Wanting Otherwise</a></span></p><h2 id=tom-segura-possibly><span class=item-num>5 </span><span>Tom Segura (Possibly)</span></h2><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On an episode of<strong> </strong>Tom Segura’s podcast Two Bears One Cave,<strong> </strong>both he and fellow comedian Yannis Pappas discussed a delusional, nameless comedian, with Pappas saying, “I'm not going to be like one of those sociopaths who comes up and goes ‘crowd’s great’ and everyone’s like ‘you just bombed.’” This prompted a reaction from Segura, stating, “Uh, I think we know who you’re talking about,” leading to speculation that the comedian in question was in fact Brendan Schaub.</p><h2 id=tim-dillon><span class=item-num>4 </span><span>Tim Dillon</span></h2><p>On an episode of Tim Dillon’s podcast which featured Luis Gomez, Dillon made his<strong> </strong>thoughts known about The Gringo Papi, saying, “The question is with that particular thing you go ‘did that have to be…, ’” before being cut off by Gomez. Dillon would added, “There’s an audience of people in America that want what he does, and he does it for them.<strong> </strong>I am not that audience.”</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Everything Bobby Lee Has Been Up To Since ‘Mad TV’</a></span></p><h2 id=ari-shaffir><span class=item-num>3 </span><span>Ari Shaffir</span></h2><p>Ari Shaffir is an often controversial comic, treading the waters of taboo subjects, who also happens to have a podcast. On an episode of Legion of Skanks (Gomez was on that episode too), Shaffir was connected to a polygraph and asked<strong> </strong>if he respected Brendan Schaub as a comedian,<strong> </strong>to which Shaffir responded yes. The results of the polygraph, however, would show that he was<strong> </strong>not telling the truth.</p><h2 id=luis-j-gomez><span class=item-num>2 </span><span>Luis J.

Gomez is a comedian/podcaster who has been showing up in this article a lot. Gomez was one of the first to voice<strong> </strong>his dislike for Schaub. Gomez has been vocal about the lack of quality of Schaub’s stand-up, had a rapper write a dis track about his comedic/fighting career, and<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"> even challenged the Thiccc Boy to a thick bout (a fight)</a>.</p><h2 id=annie-lederman><span class=item-num>1 </span><span>Annie Lederman</span></h2><p>Annie Lederman is one of the parties involved (at least peripherally) in the<strong> </strong>Schaub, Bobby Lee, and Khalyla Kuhn feud, as it was an episode of the podcast Trash Tuesday where Lederman would reveal that Schaub asked her for sexual favors. While Lederman stated in the aforementioned Trash Tuesday episode that Schaub was unfunny, and is clearly<strong> </strong>not a fan of Schaub, it’s still unknown whether she was a fan of The Gringo Papi’s Mountain Lion closing bit.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=#>These Famous Comedians Starred In Rap Videos</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiroZ2jmnqku8yem6KZnqh6or7EZqWorF2brq%2B%2FjKidZpqimrulrc1mqpygkaqvtHnCqKSenKlk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
