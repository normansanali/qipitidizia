One of his A-list romances was with <a href=#>Ariana Grande</a>. They dated and <a href=#>got engaged in a whirlwind romance</a> lasting from May to October 2018. Only a month after being spotted together, <a href=#>Pete debuted two Ariana-inspired tattoos</a>, including an "AG" on his hand and Dangerous Woman bunny ears behind his ear. Then, on June 15th, Pete broke the news that he and Ariana were officially engaged. But the couple split just four months after that.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>On the other hand, Pete and <a href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> first sparked dating in October 2021 when she hosted an episode of <a href=#>SNL</a>, and <a href=#>they shared an onscreen kiss during an Aladdin-inspired sketch</a>. Weeks later, they were spotted holding hands on a roller coaster ride at a Southern California amusement park. The couple has been dating since then. Now fans want to know Pete's mom's thoughts on his son's current relationship. Here is everything Pete Davidson's mom has said about his famous girlfriends.</p><h2 id=everything-pete-davidson-39-s-mom-has-said-about-kim-kardashian>Everything Pete Davidson's Mom Has Said About Kim Kardashian</h2><p>On Mother's Day, Kim Kardashian sent Pete Davidson's mom, Amy Waters, a beautiful arrangement of flowers. Amy was very touched by the gesture. A source close to the Kardashians revealed to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Hollywood Life</a> that Amy "absolutely adores Kim." The source added, "she thinks she is perfect for her son and doesn't care about her fame or her money." The insider said that Pete's mom only cares about how a woman treats her son (regardless of their social status) and that she's never met anyone who treats Pete with so much love and respect as Kim. Fans suspect Kim may be the greatest daughter-in-law Pete's mom has had so far.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How Does Caitlyn Jenner Really Feel About Kim And Pete's Relationship?</a></span></p><h2 id=does-pete-davidson-39-s-mom-want-him-to-have-kids-with-kim-kardashian>Does Pete Davidson's Mom Want Him To Have Kids With Kim Kardashian?</h2><p>Pete Davidson's mom, Amy Waters, is high-key lurking on posts about her son's romance with Kim Kardashian. Amy raised some serious eyebrows after she allegedly responded to a fan's comment about Kim when a fan account posted a paparazzi photo of the couple driving around Los Angeles. On the Instagram post, one excited fan expressed how much they stan Kim and Pete's relationship, writing alongside a heart emoji, "She will be pregnant with his child by the end of the year." <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Some users, including Pete's mom, seemed to agree</a> with what the commenter had to say.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In a since-deleted comment, Amy allegedly replied to the user who's predicting a Kim and Pete's baby with "Yayyy!" which fans were quick to take screenshots of before it was erased. Amy might've accidentally proved that she's the biggest Kim and Pete supporter, or maybe this is her way of not-so-subtly hinting that she wants grandkids.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Here's What Happened When MGK Went On A Double Date With Kim Kardashian And Pete Davidson</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's safe to say that things are moving fast for Pete and Kim (branding Kim's name on his skin) but not that fast. The couple has only been official for a matter of months, so fans are not sure if they'd even be thinking about babies at this point or want that at all in their future since Kim already has four kids. While the couple has been doing the long-distance thing with Kim living in LA and Pete in New York City, they seem closer than ever.</p><h2 id=everything-pete-davidson-39-s-mom-has-said-about-ariana-grande>Everything Pete Davidson's Mom Has Said About Ariana Grande</h2><p>A parent's approval can make or break a relationship, and things didn't turn out so well for Pete and Ariana when they were engaged. Pete's mom reportedly wasn't too keen on him marrying Ariana Grande. Ariana and Pete's high-speed three-month relationship caught everyone by surprise, but no one more than Pete's mom. The duo went from a potential new couple to lifelong partners in a matter of weeks, leaving fans a little concerned and a lot surprised.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Throughout their short relationship, they convinced everyone that they were in it for the long haul. The two got an apartment together, couldn't stop singing each other's praises when asked about their engagement, and all around seemed to keep the romance alive and thriving throughout their wedding planning. However, Pete's mom's hesitation in accepting Ariana with open arms went a little deeper than the average person, primarily because of Pete's mental health issues.</p><p>A source told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Us Weekly</a>, "Pete's mother was very nervous about his relationship with Ariana when they started dating. She knows her son goes through manic episodes and thought he was rushing into a relationship and would wind up getting hurt." Amy was especially worried because Pete was diagnosed with a borderline personality disorder.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pete's mom was slow to warm up to Ariana because she worried about her son's well-being. The insider added that her initial reservations about Ariana got better. However, after five months together, the couple broke up. At the moment, there's no doubt that Pete's mom's favorite daughter-in-law is Kim Kardashian and her quick acceptance of Kim's romance with Pete is the biggest proof of that.</p><p><span class=next-single>Next: <a href=#>Pete Davidson's 'SNL' Departure Benefits Kim Kardashian</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGibqJ2jYr2mwMRmm5qumZnAsLrSZqSopV2htqyxjKGgrGWWlrqwwdJmnqKqnJu%2FqrHNnapo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
