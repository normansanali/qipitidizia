Still, she said she continues to feel the painful weight of the experience to this day.</p><p>“My mind doesn’t want to even go there,” <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Insider</a>. “My legs started shaking at the thought of reliving some of it.&nbsp;… It severs the mind-body connection because I see the body as something that is shameful, that is not to be trusted. It actually ends up messing with my ability to foster genuine relationships with others and myself, because now I’m suppressing a voice. I’m trying to change something that is what I now understand very natural.”</p><p>“The dangers are measurable,” she added. “They are measurable. Even if someone comes out of it on the other side and says, ‘Hey, no, I’m living a great life,’ there are scars there. There are shadows. So yes, I’m not capable yet of going back and recounting specifics, which is an indicator of just how difficult that chapter was for me.”</p><p>At present, 20 U.S. states <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">have passed</a> laws prohibiting licensed mental health professionals from practicing conversion therapy on minors.&nbsp;The most recent state to adopt such legislation <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">was Virginia</a> in 2020.&nbsp;</p><p>The controversial practice, however, continues to be promoted, often <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">by members</a> of conservative religious groups.&nbsp;In 2019, the Williams Institute at University of California, Los Angeles, School of Law published <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">a report</a> that found that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">698,000 LGBTQ Americans</a> between the ages of 18 and 59 had undergone conversion therapy at some point in their lives.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Snq56qpJa2r7nEp6tomZyuwLC6jKyrqKaVp3qzsdWemKWrXai1pnnAraueppSasW6zwLJknKeeq7Kzv8iopWasmJq%2ForzYZquhnaKaeqK%2BxGaqnJmiqHq1tMSrnGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
