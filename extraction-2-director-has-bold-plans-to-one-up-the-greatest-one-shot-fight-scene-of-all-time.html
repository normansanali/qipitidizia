Looking at you, Citadel and The Gray Man.</p>Recommended Videos<p data-characters=325 data-current-count=325 data-injectable=false>Indeed, the Russos, who produce the sequel to the Chris Hemsworth-led opener, haven’t exactly found their feet since their work with Marvel Studios put them on the map. We’re sure they’re having a blast in bringing their action thriller dreams to life, we only wish we audiences were getting more out of it.</p><p data-characters=401 data-current-count=726 data-injectable=true>With that in mind, it’s all the more fascinating – for lack of a more tactful term – to hear exactly what this ambitious new project hopes to entail. In a recent interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">ScreenRant</a>, Extraction 2 director Sam Hargrave revealed a few of the script’s intricacies, including a note that had but one instruction; make a one-take fight scene that puts that of <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Oldboy</a> to shame.</p><p>“The gauntlet had been laid, and then when it came out in its script form, the descriptor I think was, ‘A sequence to rival Oldboy‘ and ‘The greatest oner in cinema history,’ those kinds of things, which read really well, when you’re reading it, like, “Oh my gosh, yes, it’s gonna be amazing, I can picture it.” But then, it’s my job to make that happen, which is daunting.”</p><p data-characters=531 data-current-count=531 data-injectable=true>It sounds like Hargrave isn’t entirely lost on how absurd a guideline like “be better than Oldboy” is. On top of trying to rival one of the greatest films of all-time, let alone just action films, creating something with the chief goal of being better than something else is a surefire way to come out with something half-baked. Nevertheless, we commend his apparent efforts to follow such a rule, and hope that the dreams of everyone involved come to fruition; the viewers will be the ones to benefit, after all.</p><p data-characters=48 data-current-count=48 data-injectable=false>Extraction 2 will release to Netflix on June 16.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJonLGsopawtbXOp2RrZZSev6av06ipZqCRqHqju8udZKmkkaPAbsDOZqannV2qvW7Ax55koKqVlsGmv9NmpqedXai1sMCMn6CgoKRiwKSxzZ5kqJ5dlrmtedOipJ5n</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
