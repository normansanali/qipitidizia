According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, she's worth $5 million as of September 2020 — a boast-worthy sum to anyone, especially considering that she's only in her early 30s.</p><p>As for how Gretzky earned her dough, let it be known that the model has landed such magazine covers as <a href=#>Flare</a>&nbsp;("Canada's Fashion Magazine"), as well as <a href=#>Golf Digest</a>. Gretzky's <a href=#>Instagram</a> account is also chock-full of professional photos of her posing in bikinis. Her modeling career makes sense, as her mom, actress Janet Jones, is also known for her blonde, good looks.</p><p>In addition to her time spent modeling, Gretzky has also had a bit of a pop career. She began singing as a teenager with a rendition of Sarah McLachlan's "I Will Remember You" before one of her dad's hockey games, surprising the audience with her talent. She also released the track, "Collecting Dust," which was featured on everyone's fave '00s reality show, <a href=#>Laguna Beach</a>. (The song is legitimately good — check it out on <a href=#>YouTube</a>.)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZma2xkaYN3e8%2BarKWhnpZ6qL7ErbGksV2dvLh5zK6aoWWZqHq1tMRmpKiclaF6uLvRrZ9o</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
