Smith received the first technical foul in the history of the Celebrity Game during a frustrating&nbsp;62-47 loss to fellow ESPN commentator&nbsp;Michael Wilbon's team. Across the sports landscape, Smith is known for his high energy hot takes. That style translated entertainingly well to the basketball court, but also, was a nuisance to the referees who decided to hit him with a tech during the third quarter.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"Ultimately, you got to make shots. We weren't making shots.

The Chicago rapper earned the MVP award for his performance.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">"I just wanted to represent Chicago for cats like Quentin Richardson, Derrick Rose and all the ballers that come from here, for Isiah Thomas. I wore Ben Wilson's number because I wanted to represent our city,"&nbsp;Common&nbsp;said after the game.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The NBA All-Star game will tip-off at 8:00 PM on Sunday, February 16th.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Cole Blake is currently an Editor at HotNewHipHop based out of Brooklyn, New York.
