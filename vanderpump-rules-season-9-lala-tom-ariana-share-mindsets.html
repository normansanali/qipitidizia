They’ve got a lot to catch up on too: Kent and <a href=#><strong>Scheana Shay</strong></a> have since become parents.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Lala-Kent-Tom-Sandoval-and-Ariana-Madix-Reveal-Their-Mindsets-Ahead-of-Vanderpump-Rules-Season-9.jpg><p>“We went from zero to a hundred real fast,” Kent said. “It was like, ‘We’re drinking all the time, having the best day ever, to like, ‘Oh my gosh, I can’t go out tonight and I have to feed every two and a half hours.’ It’s going to be a lot of fun to watch.”</p><p>Sandoval, 37, and Madix, 35, haven’t had added any members to their family since last season, but they agree that<a href=#> the new episodes will allow the cast to let loose</a>.</p><p>“I have pent-up, like, energy … I want to go party,” the comedian told Us while promoting her and Sandoval’s “Wake Up Call” mocktail recipe made with Alka-Seltzer. “I’m just ready to party. I don’t have any pent-up drama.”</p><p>For his part, Sandoval doesn’t think he has “pent-up drama” either, but he does agree with his partner’s idea about pent-up energy. “Even just the vibe out here,” he said. “Being out a little bit in, like, West Hollywood … everybody is, like, definitely ready to go. So, when it happens, when we’re allowed to go full force … I’m really excited that L.A. has been doing very well.”</p><p>Madix is curious to see how all that partying plays out now that some of <a href=#>her fellow cast members have babies at home</a>. “I do think it’s going to be really interesting just to see how things roll … with <a href=#>Lala and Scheana being new moms</a>,” she shared. “I think it’s just going to be a very interesting thing to watch. Obviously, I’m in it, so it’s a little bit different, but I predict that the viewers will be pleased.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>They certainly will be if Kent has anything to say about it. “I’m also excited because I’m crazy like this and built for reality TV,” she joked. “No one’s safe!
