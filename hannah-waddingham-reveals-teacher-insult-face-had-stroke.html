And I went, ‘Do you know what? I think I’ve done enough . . . This isn’t cool anymore. Why should I be constantly feeding into someone else’s storyline?’ ” she said.</p><p>“So I said to my agents at the time, ‘I’m not doing it anymore . . . If it’s one scene, I’m not doing it anymore, and you shouldn’t be putting me up for it, because it’s insulting,’ ” Waddingham continued. “I’ve been a leading lady for 22 years. I’m not doing it anymore. I’d rather be in a world where I’m appreciated.’”</p><p>Waddingham “fully stepped back” from acting at one point, before landing the role of Septa Unella on “Game of Thrones,” which she played in seasons 5 and 6.</p><p>Waddingham has been keeping busy since “Ted Lasso” ended with Season 3 last year. Up next, she’s set to star in and executive produce a new eight-episode comedy Prime Video series from creator Tessa Coates alongside Octavia Spencer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3V7j2pmam9fmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvHmqWnmZhixKKww6KloKCRonqzsdWemKWrXamyoq%2FHnqlmoZ6owq3AjJ%2BYnJ1dna6ledKtqaijlWQ%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
