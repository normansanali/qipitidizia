Vernon Dursley is a muggle <b>born on September 11,1954</b>.</p><p>Subsequently, Is Petunia older than Lily? Petunia Dursley (n√©e Evans) (pre 1960 ‚Äì pre 2020) was a Muggle, the eldest daughter of Mr and Mrs Evans, and the <b>older sister of</b> the Muggle-born witch Lily. ‚Ä¶ However, when Lily was killed by Lord Voldemort, Petunia became the guardian of her nephew, Harry Potter, who was only an infant then.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_does_Vernon_Dursley_hate_the_Potters></span>Why does Vernon Dursley hate the Potters?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Rowling adds that Vernon hated Harry <b>because he saw father James in him</b>, much in the same way that Snape does. ‚Ä¶ It has been previously theorised that the Dursleys hated Harry because he was one of Voldemort‚Äôs Horcruxes ‚Äì thus the magic around him warped their minds.</p><p>Is Aunt Petunia a squib? The theory stems from JK Rowling‚Äôs answer to a fan question during a 2004 conversation at the Edinburgh Book Festival. The fan asked the author if Aunt Petunia was a Squib (a non-magical person who is born to at least one magical parent) and Rowling replied: ‚Ä¶ <b>No, she is not, she is not a Squib</b>.

She is a Muggle.</p><p>What was in Vault 713? Vault 713 is the ‚Äútop security‚Äù vault underneath Gringotts Bank where <b>Dumbledore kept the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone (PS5)</b>. Harry expected to see jewels and gold inside, but there was only the ‚Äúgrubby little package‚Äù concealing what he later realized was the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone (PS5, PS9). ‚Ä¶</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Was_James_Potter_a_bully></span>Was James Potter a bully?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>James was a bully in school</b> ‚Äî to the point that even the biggest of James Potter apologists can‚Äôt deny this. He mercilessly teased Snape, and in one particularly horrific memory, hung him upside down and exposed him in front of the entire school.</p><p>Why is Petunia not a witch? So according to one Tumblr user, Aunt Petunia actually <b>isn‚Äôt a Muggle</b> but a bitter ol‚Äô witch, who suppressed her powers after being rejected by the magical community. The theory stems from JK Rowling‚Äôs answer to a fan question during a 2004 conversation at the Edinburgh Book Festival. ‚Ä¶ She is a Muggle.</p><p>Why was Petunia not allowed to go to Hogwarts?</p><p>Dumbledore responded saying that Petunia may not study at Hogwarts, and even though he responded kindly, Petunia <b>felt hurt and left out</b>, which also in part could have been because her parents were so proud of Lily‚Äôs talents.</p><p>Did Petunia go to Lily‚Äôs funeral? Apparently Petunia arranged the funeral for Lily and James, choosing for <b>them to be buried in Godrics Hollow</b>. Petunia was the only member left of Liliy‚Äôs and James‚Äô family so it was left for her to do.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Did_Dudley_have_a_magical_child></span>Did Dudley have a magical child?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Another fact about Dudley was revealed by Rowling after the books. ‚Ä¶ Rowling talked about how <b>she almost gave Dudley a magical child himself</b>. She considered having him be at Platform 9 ¬æ during the epilogue.</p><p>What did Dumbledore‚Äôs Howler to Petunia mean?</p><p>Dumbledore had a sufficient foresight as to what would happen after the attack. He immediately dispatched a howler to Petunia. The howler <b>reminded her that Harry‚Äôs fate thus, would be the same for her family, if she decided to let him go, and break the charm.</b> <b>Hence she decided to let him stay.</b> <b>Not</b> for his protection.</p><p>Who sent the howler to Petunia? A Howler from <b>Dumbledore</b>, addressed to Petunia, said ‚ÄòRemember my last‚Äô ‚Äì no doubt referring to the letter which he left with baby Harry, on the doorstep of Privet Drive. But there was another occasion when Albus had a reason to write, and it had long-lasting consequences.</p><p>Is Hermione a Squib? Hermione is <b>a witch born to muggle parents but has magic in her blood</b>. The term that describes this occurrence is called a squib. A family can pass down magic genes that await for the right combination of genes in parents to create a child that is a witch or a wizard even if they are muggles themselves.</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_vault_is_Harry_Potters></span>What vault is Harry Potters?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>Vault 687</b> in Gringotts Wizarding Bank belongs to the Potter family. It appears to be of moderate depth and deeper underground than the vault of the Weasley family, but not as deep as Vault 713. It is accessible only by a Mine Cart operated by one of the bank‚Äôs goblin employees, and by using a small gold key.</p><p>Who emptied vault 713?

It was removed by <b>Rubeus Hagrid</b> on the 31st July 1990.</p><p>What was in the letter Hagrid gave to the goblin?</p><p>Letter information</p><p>The letter presumably requested permission to transfer <b>the Philosopher‚Äôs Stone</b> from Vault 713 to Hogwarts Castle, as a greater degree of security than even the bank‚Äôs vaults provided was deemed necessary by Dumbledore.</p><p>What is James Potter‚Äôs animagus? James Potter</p><p>James‚Äôs Animagus form was that of <b>a stag</b>, which earned him his nickname, Prongs.

He learned that James had been something of a <b>bully in his</b> youth, witnessing a memory of Snape‚Äôs, in which James and Sirius picked on and humiliated Snape simply because they were bored.</p><p>What did James do to Severus? Following an O.W.L. exam, James, with partner in crime Sirius Black, confronted the vulnerable young Snape, pinned him to the ground, filled his mouth with pink soap bubbles then lifted him into <b>the air</b>, threatening to completely undress the pale, slight Slytherin boy in front of a giggling crowd of fellow students.</p><h2></h2><p>Don‚Äôt forget to share this post üñ§</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbBnnp1kxKm7jKmjmrGVmXq3sdGnpqdllKq%2FtLjEsmSipl2drrO%2B2GanqKykmr9ufo4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
