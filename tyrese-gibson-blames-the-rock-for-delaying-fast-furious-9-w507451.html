Nah….. It’s about #TeamDwayne #3yrs will it be worth the wait? #NoShaw just Hobbs will this be another #BayWatch? Guys guys just relax I’m just a passionate film critic.”</p><p>According to <i>Variety</i>, <i>Fast and Furious 9 </i>was set to be released in April 2019, but Universal Studios postponed the premiere date for undisclosed reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>The former model then posted an older photo of the cast and wrote,” Diversity, love, multi<br>ethnic worldwide multi generational, United Nations, One Race, Fast<br>Family…… Until Dewayne showed up I guess this whole time he had a<br>problem cause he wasn’t the ONLY ONE on the movie poster……….. I<br>guess dreams do come true congratulations to <a href=#>@hhgarcia41</a> and <a href=#>@therock</a> you guys are just amazing you really broke up the <a href=#>#FastFamily</a><br>I tried to warn you guys… You thought I was hating…… I was simply<br>fighting to keep the family together what makes us great is when you<br>see us all TOGETHER we don’t fly solo….. <a href=#>#MyLastPost</a> today…..

Last month, Gibson made a since-deleted comment on an Instagram photo Johnson shared in which the former WWE star was doing some paperwork.</p><p>“I’m simply trying to reach him because we won’t call me back about this solo #HobbsMovie,” Gibson wrote at the time, alluding to a potential spinoff centered around The Rock’s character, Luke Hobbs. “I want you to shoot it just not right now cause the #Fast9 release date has already been announced.”</p><p>“Didn’t you see how HUGE #Fast8 was? It’s because we announced and KEPT our release date bro,” he continued. “We can’t let our loyal fans #FastFamily or our loyal ‘Fast & Furious’ FANS down on any level from pushing the date.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>This isn’t the first time that The Rock has feuded with a <i>Fast and Furious </i>costar. Johnson shared a cryptic Instagram post in August 2016, slamming several of his male costars for being unprofessional “candy asses.” Shortly after, TMZ reported that the rant was aimed at<b> <a href=#>Vin Diesel</a></b>, who later responded on his on Instagram account writing, “Give me a second, and I will tell you Everything. Everything.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Diesel <a href=#>spoke about the feud</a> during an interview with <i>USA Today </i>in April 2017, explaining, “some things may [have been] blown out of proportion.”</p><p><i>Us Weekly </i>has reached out to The Rock’s rep and Universal Studios for comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGatsaKawKZ5xqKZrKeeYq%2BtrcyeqmasmJp6s7vCpGSfp6Jisaa4wLKgp59dm660wIyfrKuhn6rAboWMsGxpb2RqfnA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
