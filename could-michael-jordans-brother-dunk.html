While Michael pursued a legendary career in the NBA, Larry also had a strong passion for basketball.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>He played college basketball at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington, where he demonstrated his skills on the court. Though not as famous as his brother, Larry's basketball abilities were noteworthy in their own right.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Dunking Ability</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>While it is widely known that Michael Jordan possessed an extraordinary dunking ability, there is limited information available about Larry's dunking prowess.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Given that Larry was not a professional basketball player like his brother, there is not as much public footage or documentation of his playing career. Yet, anecdotal evidence suggests that Larry was indeed capable of dunking the basketball.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Genetics and Athleticism</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>The Jordan family's athletic genes are well-documented, with both Michael and Larry showcasing their basketball talents. It is widely believed that genetics play a significant role in an individual's athletic abilities, including their jumping and dunking capabilities.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Given their shared genetic makeup, it is reasonable to assume that Larry possessed a degree of the same athleticism that made Michael famous for his high-flying dunks.</p><h2 data-mce-fragment=1>Personal Accounts</h2><p data-mce-fragment=1>While there may not be extensive video evidence of Larry Jordan's dunking prowess, there are personal accounts that provide insight into his abilities on the basketball court.</p><p data-mce-fragment=1>Friends, teammates, and individuals who witnessed Larry play have occasionally shared stories of his skills, including his capability to dunk the basketball.
