I went underwater for a second, and when I came back up, he was screaming at the top of his lungs. Literally, in three seconds, the girl had been swept 150 yards out.”</p><p>Krasinski reacted immediately. “In that moment, I didn’t ask anyone. There was no one to help me. I just went out and tried to save her,” he recalled. “And then, of course, when I got out there, I was in a crosscurrent with her. It was one of those moments of ‘Oh, my God, you just made a poor choice and it might cost you your life.’”</p><p>The&nbsp;Jack Ryan&nbsp;star noted that he “didn’t think about it like that” at the time. “It was just this survival instinct,” he said. “It was really weird — like the girl was asking me to let her die. But I got her back.”</p><p>Surfers eventually interceded to help them make it back to the shore, but the moment stuck with Krasinski. “Granted, not everybody needs to have life-or-death experiences, but that changed my entire life,” he revealed. “All of a sudden I grew up.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Meanwhile, other&nbsp;celebrities — such as <a href=#><strong>Idris Elba</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Tom Cruise</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Ryan Gosling</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lawrence</strong></a> — have similar stories that occurred after they achieved worldwide recognition.</p><p>Scroll down to revisit stars’ heroic efforts to help others through the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNksrex0bKbmrFdmLKtscFmn56qn5rAbn6PamlqaWRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
