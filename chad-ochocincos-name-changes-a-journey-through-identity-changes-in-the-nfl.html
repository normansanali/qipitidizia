Andy Lyons/Getty Images</p><p>One of the NFL's most colorful wide receivers, Chad Ochocinco made life interesting for sports fans on and off the field with his name. This is the fascinating tale of Chad Johnson and how he became Chad Ochocinco then back to Jonson again, and what such changes mean around.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Birth of Ochocinco</h2><p>During Hispanic Heritage Month in 2006, Chad Johnson announced his desire to change his birth name to Ochocinco as a tribute to his jersey number of "85". Eventually, rather than pointing out this discrepancy (Ocho is eight and cinco means five in Spanish), he humorously adopted the Ochocinco nickname as a light-hearted alter ego for media attention.<br data-mce-fragment=1>After legally changing his surname from Johnson, he took until 2009 to add Ochocinco to the back of his uniform so as not to be required by Reebok to purchase leftover stock. This transformation was a real part of his day-by-day playfulness, however, it demonstrated how he could enchant the audience with unexpected behavior.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Return to Johnson</h2><p>After a few years as Ochocinco, Chad Johnson went back to going by that name in 2012 - only he made it his middle name. His newfound reversal was due to his relationship with reality TV star Evelyn Lozada. The couple wanted a real name for Evelyn's other last names, so Chad changed his jersey to "Johnson". While the change in personal conviction was half-joking, Johnson pointed out that Ochocinco still dabbled within him as it resided only as a middle name.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>Impact and Reception</h2><p>The name changes of Chad Ochocinco have not only been a personal exploration, but they have also influenced his public perception and how fans receive him. His charming, whimsical attitude about name changes and his unconventional on-and-off-the-field antics will make him a love-or-hate player.<br data-mce-fragment=1>While his stunts are meant to entertain and stand into the limelight, this has drawn backlash from fans as they do not find them funny Johnson has been polarizing, and much of the prevailing public opinion is likely to be on display, as he recently topped an NFL survey ranking him one of its most disliked players.</p><h2><br data-mce-fragment=1>The Legacy of Ochocinco</h2><p>Chad Ochocinco's name changes will never be forgotten in the sports world. This unique ability to entertain and captivate audiences with his playful alter ego has differentiated him from every other personality in the NFL, between&nbsp;his TD celebrations and off-field antics, Ochocinco has branded himself as not just a football player but a larger-than-life character who will forever be remembered by the league's fans.<br data-mce-fragment=1>Thus, whenever people say the name of Chad Ochocinco they picture somebody who was a sports personality that exhibited playfulness and mania to an extent.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiekaOus6%2FHZ5qopV%2BXubCz0miln6RfmLWisIyomqGnk567pLvSZqWapZVisKmtzaCcrGWRYrewwdGnnLJlpJ2%2FsMHGoWSinJWjwarA2GaaoZmenLK0ecinZK2glWK7p7g%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
