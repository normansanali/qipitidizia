The 21-year-old gymnast has settled her NIL deals wings while primarily focusing on her final competition. Stepping on the mats might mean the last of her competitive days since she decided to pursue other dreams after graduating. A few days ago, Livvy said, “ I am so excited for one last go around and hopefully make it my best one yet.”</p><p>If you know her, you know sharing fun content with her 14M followers on social platforms is a part of her routine. Busy sharing serious practice clips, <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>Olivia Dunne</a> let her girl-next-door vibe collaborating with another <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>gymnast</a>.</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>Olivia Dunne burst gymnastics myths</h2><p>In an Instagram video posted by LSU gymnast Savannah Schoenherr, the duo was seen taking turns sarcastically sharing things female gymnasts often hear. Schoenherr went first up saying, “we’re gymnasts of course, we walk around with chalk on our legs all day.” Another frank judgment came from Savannah while sitting on the foam, “of course, we can’t hang out, we’re at practice.”</p><p>The trail followed as Livvy appeared and continued, “We’re gymnasts, of course, we’re comfortable being half-naked all the time.” Keeping the constant words, next up, her friend said, “It looks like we’ve construction worker hands (proceeds to show her palm).” Followed by Livvy, “We’re gonna pee ourselves when we tumble.”</p><p>Another one from Olivia went like, “Of course, our ass is better than yours” while she coyly turned to give a peak in her sweatpants. Then, Savannah said, “Of course, we could beat your boyfriend up or your girlfriend.” Finally, the clip concluded with Olivia saying, “We’re just gonna hang out like this(with one leg up 90 degrees). The gymnast captioned it, “Just gymnast girly things.”&nbsp;</p><h2 class=jsx-cb26a7af5694ead9>The gymnastics practice and recovery</h2><p>Juggling social media and professional commitment to LSU Tigers, Olivia often stuns the internet with her training videos. Not long back, the gymnast after remaining absent from most of her competition last year due to an ankle injury is back for the showdown.</p><a href=# class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b transparent-card"><img id="img-tag-us-sports-news-olympics-news-gymnastics-news-giving-kim-kardashian-fierce-competition-olivia-dunne-breaks-the-internet-with-her-crib?utm_campaign=internal_links&utm_medium=dive_deeper&utm_source=website-embed-image" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/image-cdn.essentiallysports.com/wp-content/uploads/Olivia-Dunne-14-315x315.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class="jsx-9bcc7694f95d3e8b card-content">Giving Kim Kardashian Fierce Competition, Olivia Dunne Breaks The Internet With Her “Crib”</p></a><p>According to Olivia, winning is “an unprecedented territory for LSU gymnastics.” Hence, Livvy is already preparing for <a href=# class=jsx-2b55705d932ea6e9>war outside social media</a>.
