Possibly the most Instagrammable hair colour combo we've ever seen, this dreamy look works for blonde hair and consists of every colour imaginable â€“ a kaleidoscope of shades, if you will. The beauty about this look is you can't see where one colour ends and another begins. Granted, rainbow hair isn't new but this look is much more toned down and is almost a subtle take on the look. Portland-based hair stylist Lindsay Wolf chatted to <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Allure</a> about the trend, which works best on icy-platinum blonde hair. And while she herself calls it 'watercolour rainbow' and 'rainbow river' hair, it's been dubbed on Instagram as 'Kaleidoscope hair' thanks to the constant changing pattern when the hair moves.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/672dc8c9d11a-kaleidoscope-hair-1-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eMLqw35Vv3k1 data-wc=11><strong>Lindsay Wolf created the look and shared it on her <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Instagram</a> page</strong></p><p id=el7jVKZ1Hcso data-wc=63>"This look was inspired by nature, specifically the rainbows of the Pacific Northwest," Lindsay&nbsp;told Allure. "I knew I wanted it to be a softer take on bolder rainbow hair looks I'd been seeing a lot of. I wanted the shades to look fluid, as though they were melting into each other, not being able to see where each color begins or ends."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/944dd03a17ed-kaleidoscope-hair-2-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eK6-cmZIoxKu data-wc=16><strong>Rainbow hair is a trend that's been around for a while. This look was created by <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Justine Carlisle</a></strong></p><p id=eP8jipEjSRGH data-wc=90>The prismatic effect was created by lightening her client's hair to an icy <a class=hm-link href=#>platinum blonde</a>. This involved two trips to the hair salon to get the perfect icy blonde, and for the third visit Lindsay painted on the pastel dyes from from hairstylist Guy Tang's Mydentity range. From Pink Diamond to Lavender Lust and Mint of Steel, she also applied Pulp Riot's Powder (a sky blue shade) and Lemon (a pastel yellow) and the process took five hours to complete because she had to switch between four different patterns of colours.</p><p id=eTmYpUTEEy2I data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Rose brown hair is the 2018 pastel hair trend for brunettes</a></strong></p><p id=ebf1kXopkEv8 data-wc=24>"I actually had to write them down and hang them in front of me so I didn't forget which colour came next," she admitted.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/7b8f25183505-kaleidoscope-hair-3-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e9mG0ec2w4SD data-wc=7><strong>Introducing the <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>Shimmering Waterfall</a> look, as created by Wolf</strong></p><p id=eM7mYRaPr6WQ data-wc=55>If you're desperate to try the look out for yourself, Lindsay says it's best for those with natural medium to light blonde hair with a fine to medium texture. She also recommends finding a stylist who is confident with working with direct dyes. Once you do so, ask them for a "multi-toned pastel colour melt".</p><p id=edKwzpkcRJlp data-wc=1><strong>RELATED: <a class=hm-link href=#>How to protect your hair colour for longer</a></strong></p><p id=eYNDsWnhKYZF data-wc=24>In total, the process took 13 hours and requires "an investment of time, money, and patience, but the results are so, so worth it."</p><p id=eJojq0pAbdk9 data-wc=4>We couldn't agree more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaJ%2BaoaJkf3F9l2lqanFkbH16hI6kmKWdmZm8tK%2FOqZxmoJGev26vzqWmrqpdqb%2BmusNo</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 ZBlogY - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/floating.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://js.zainuddin.my.id/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
